It's obvious, really: the Greeks would never suggest bewaring of themselves, if one can use such a participle (bewaring, that is). And it's clearly Latin, not because timeo ends in \"-o\", because the Greek first person also ends in \"-o\" -- although actually there is a Greek word timao, meaning 'I honour'. But the \"-os\" ending is a nominative singular termination of a second declension in Greek, and an accusative plural in Latin, of course, though actually Danaos is not only the Greek for 'Greek'; it's also the Latin for 'Greek'. It's very interesting, really."
