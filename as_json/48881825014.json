   "quote-text" : "The Silurian system was first identified by British geologist Sir Roderick Impey Murchison, who was examining fossil-bearing sedimentary rock strata in south Wales in the early 1830s. He named the sequences for a Celtic tribe of Wales, the Silures, inspired by his friend Adam Sedgwick, who had named the period of his study the Cambrian, the Latin name for Wales. This naming does not indicate any correlation between the occurrence of the Silurian rocks and the land inhabited by the Silures; cf. Geology of Wales, Tribes of Wales. In 1835 the two men presented a joint paper, under the title On the Silurian and Cambrian Systems, Exhibiting the Order in which the Older Sedimentary Strata Succeed each other in England and Wales, which was the germ of the modern geological time scale. As it was first identified, the &ldquo;Silurian&rdquo; series when traced farther afield quickly came to overlap Sedgwick&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cambrian&rdquo; sequence, however, provoking furious disagreements that ended the friendship.",
