   "answer" : "<p>wellâ¦ well first off, iâd say, seek professional help immediately. because i am wildly unqualified to answer your question with anything but experience. and first off, my experience says, if you are in such a deep and dark place where you say things like this to total strangers on the internet, you need to be in contact with someone that can help you start to heal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>second, iâd sayâ¦ youâre wrong. iâd say the things any of us donât know, especially about tomorrow, could blanket every grain of sand on every beach of the world with bullshit. And to simply assume you are done tomorrow because you are done today is a mistake. a factual mistake, an error, a critical miscalculation.</p>\n\n\n<p>iâd say, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/10/13/031013fa_fact?currentPage=all\">read Tad Friendâs piece JUMPERS</a> in which he seeks and finds and talks to people that jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge â and lived. And they all say the same variations this: âI instantly realized that everything in my life that Iâd thought was unfixable was totally fixableâexcept for having just jumped.âÂ </p>\n\n<p>And know that this piece has kept me in my seat on more than a couple dark nights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And iâd say â iâd say i felt that way before too, and i was wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then iâd tell you something i donât even think my wife knows. this happend years before we met â shit, more than a decade â and itâs not Â  the first time i came close to suicide was on a thanksgiving night. iâd eaten well and then as the house shut down i went into the bathroom, drew a bath as hot as i could manage to stand, and climbed into the tub with a razor Â blade.</p>\n\n<p>As i started to cut, as the corner touched my skin and that jolt of pain fired into my head, i stopped and thought â yâknow, last chance. Are you SURE?</p>\n\n<p>And i was tired. I sounded like you, that i knew thereâd be ups again and downs but i was just so fucking TIRED i couldnât stand the thought of having to get there. I felt thisâ¦ this never-ending crush of days that were grey and tepid but for some reason i was supposed to greet each one with a smile. the constant pressure of having to keep my shit in all the time was just exhausting.</p>\n\n<p>I wondered, then â well, is there anything youâre curious about. Anything you want to see play out. And i thought of a comic i was reading and iâd not figured out the end of the current storyline. And i realized I had curiosity. And that was the hook iâd hang my hat on. that by wanting to see how something played out I wasnât really ready. That little sprout of a thing poking up through all that black earth kept me around a little longer.</p>\n\n<p>I realized then that it had been so long since iâd laughed. I was numbed out and shut down and justâ¦ i missed laughing. maybe if i laughed a little i could get moving again. so iâd wait for my comic to conclude, try to find a few laughs, and then <em>reevaluate</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So Iâm in the bathtub and i got this real sharp-ass razor, right? And i look down and thereâs all my bits floating in the water like they do and i thoughtÂ <em>okay, letâs get funnyÂ </em>and i got to work.</p>\n\n<p>I shaved off exactly half my pubic hair vertically. The end result was a âfro of pubes that looked like a Chia Pet that only half-worked. I started to laugh as I did it. And every time iâd piss, looking down made me laugh.Â </p>\n\n<p>Because JESUS what a nightmare.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly thereafter I got very heavily into Chuck Jones and Tex Avery. Way less chafing and way more funny.</p>\n\n<p>jesus. i was still in high school at the time. dig if you will a picture of the chubby weirdo that was always giggling at his dick in the bathroom.Â <em>that was me</em>.</p>\n\n\n<p>And then I guess Iâd tell you about Dave, who did the same thing as me a few years later, only DIDNâT have my hilarious Chia Dick strategy in mind and got the razor in and up. And as he started to bleed out âBrown Eyed Girlâ came on the radio and he realized heâd never get to hear that again so, in a bloody comedy of errors â I swear to god this is true â he got out of the tub, tried to get dressed the best he could, went downstairs calling for help only to find his family gone, went out to his car, and drove to dougâs house only to find doug not home and so, then, finally, he blacked out from blood loss sitting there in his car, playing a van morrison CD on repeat, until, by luck, Dougâs mom came home and found him.Â </p>\n\n<p>Fucking Van Morrison, yâknow?</p>\n\n\n<p>A song, a comic, something dumb, something small. From that seed can come everything else, I swear to god.</p>\n\n<p>I guess last Iâd sayâ¦ Iâd say that, look â if you reached out to me for an answer, than I have to reach back out to you and insist you hear it. Â Because it means, what, you know me? My work? You read my stuff and thought, well, fuck, if anyone would know why I shouldnât end my life, if anyone alive is QUALIFIED TO SAVE ME itâs the guy that had britney spears punch a bear? okay â okay, then, so as THAT GUY Iâm saying: Get help. Now, today, tonight, whenever â get to a phone and find a doctor that can try to help you heal, that can try to recolorize your world again, that can help you start caring again. All you need is that one tiny thing, that speck, that little grain of sand. the World Series, AVENGERS 2, Tina Feyâs new show, the first issue of PRETTY DEADLY, some slice of the world youâve never seen, some drink you love, who the fuck will love your dog like you do if youâre gone, what if jabrams KILLS it on the new STAR WARS, the hell are you doing for Halloween, you ever feed a dolphin with your bare hand? because i have and I am fucking telling you IT IS A THING TO EXPERIENCE and oh god WHAT FUCKING FONT WILL STARBUCKS USE ON THE CHRISTMAS DRINK SLEEVES THIS YEAR â i donât care what or how dumb but i promise you somewhere in your life is that one fleck of dust that can help start you on the road back. Thatâs all it takes. One fucking mote, drifting through your head.Â </p>\n\n<p>And because you asked me I am answering you because i know, motherfucker, i know, i know, i know the hole you are fucking in because I was there myself and if you look hard you can still see my writing on those walls and if you stare long enough i swear to god itâs pointing to up</p>",

Can&#039;t there be someone out there who genuinely is tired and doesn&#039;t want to continue. I know there is beauty and wonderful things in this world. There are things to look forward to.
