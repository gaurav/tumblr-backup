   "quote-text" : "<p>He waited until the train was in motion to make his moveâa true sign of someone who knows how to make the environment work to their advantage.  Then he leaned forward.  âHi.&ldquo;  âHow you doing?&rdquo;  âWhat are you reading?&ldquo;  âWhatâs your name?&rdquo; âI really like your hair.&ldquo; âThatâs a really nice skirt.&rdquo;  âYou must work out.&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>It was painful to watch.  She clearly wanted nothing to do with him, and he clearly wasnât going to take the hint.  Her rebukes got firmer.  âIâd like to read my book.&rdquo;  And he pulled out the social pressure.  âHey, Iâm just asking you a question.  You donât have to be so rude.&ldquo;  She started to look around for outs.  Her head swiveled from one exit to another.</p>\n\n<p>The thing was, I had already heard this story, many many times.  I knew how it would play out.  I knew all the tropes.  I probably could have quoted the lines before they said them.  I wanted a new narrative.  Time to mix it up.</p>\n\n<p>So I moved seats until I was sitting behind him.  I leaned forward with my head on the back of his seat.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hi,&rdquo; I said with a little smile.</p>\n\n<p>He looked at me like I was a little crazyâwhich isnât exactly untrueâand turned back to her.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;How are you doing?&rdquo;  I asked.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Iâm fine,&rdquo; he said flatly without ever looking back.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I really like your hair,&rdquo; I said.  âIt looks soft.&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>Thatâs about when it gotâ¦..weird.</p>\n\n<p>He sort of half turned and glared back me, and I could tell I was pissing him off.  His eyes told me to back the hell away, and his lips were pressed together tightly enough to drain the color from them completely.</p>\n\n<p>But no good story ever ends with the conflict just defusing.  He started to turn back to her.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Wait, donât be like that,&rdquo; I said.  âLemmie just ask you one questionâ¦&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said in that you-have-clearly-gone-too-far voice that is part of the freshmen year finals at the school of machismo.</p>\n\n<p>And Iâm not exactly a hundred percent sure why I didnât call it a day at that point, butâ¦..maybe I just love turning the screw to see what happens.   I gave him the bedroomy-est eyes I could muster.  âWhatâs your name?&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>Right now Iâm sitting here typing out this story, and Iâm still not entirely sure why Iâm not nursing a fat lip or a black eye.  Because that obviously made him so mad that I still am not sure why it didnât come to blows.  There are cliches about eyes flaring and rage behind someones eyes and shit like that that are so overdone.  But it really does look like that.  When someone gets violent, their eyes just kind of âpop&rdquo; with intentionâpupils dilate, eyelids widen. And his did. Even sitting down he was clearly bigger than me and I was pretty sure he was kind of muscular too, so at that moment I was figuring I was probably going to need an ice pack and sympathy sex from my girlfriend by dayâs end.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;DUDE,&rdquo; he shouted.  âIâM NOT GAY.&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>Thatâs when I dropped the bedroom eyes and switched to a normal voice.  âOh well I could see not being interested didnât matter to you when you were hitting on her, so I just thought thatâs how you rolled.&rdquo;</p>",
