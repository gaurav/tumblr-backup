   "quote-source" : "Scott Westerfeld on <a href=\"http://scottwesterfeld.com/blog/2012/04/new-uglies-uk-covers/\">the experience of reading a novel</a> (and other things)",
   "quote-text" : "<p>I keep saying âmodernâ because it wasnât always this way. When the novel was a younger form, lots of them started with some sort of leisurely preamble, like, âThis strange tale you are about to read was discovered in an old sea chest blah blah blah.â But in novels these days, the first sentences usually go BOOM THESE ARE SOMEONE ELSEâS THOUGHTSâDEAL WITH IT. Like, âWhen I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold.â</p>\n\n<p>Itâs the opposite of egocentrism, letting yourself become another person for a few hours. Especially when that person lives in a radically different reality, like a post-scarcity utopia or a post-apocalyptic wasteland. This departure from self is essential to reading novels, and itâs one of the ways that reading makes us better people. (Itâs key to writing as well, which is why I <a href=\"http://scottwesterfeld.com/blog/2009/03/hairy-fruit/\">gave this advice</a> three years ago.)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, thereâs also a positive side of making our egos central to the reading process: When we read new books, we use the knowledge gained from all the other books weâve read. We supplement the story of a novel with the story of our own reading history. This is a major reason why people can react to the same novel differently[&hellip;].</p>",
