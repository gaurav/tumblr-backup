   "quote-text" : "<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what I *think*,&rdquo; the chairman replied testily. Â &quot;You see, when<br/>\nwe first noticed this happening, a few days ago&ndash;&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You waited a few DAYS?&rdquo; I interrupted, a tremor tinging my voice. Â &quot;And you couldn&rsquo;t send email this whole time?&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We could send email. Â Just not more than&ndash;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;&ndash;500 miles, yes,&rdquo; I finished for him, &ldquo;I got that. Â But why didn&rsquo;t you<br/>\ncall earlier?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Well, we hadn&rsquo;t collected enough data to be sure of what was going on<br/>\nuntil just now.&rdquo; Â Right. Â This is the chairman of *statistics*. &ldquo;Anyway, I<br/>\nasked one of the geostatisticians to look into it&ndash;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Geostatisticians&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;&ndash;yes, and she&rsquo;s produced a map showing the radius within which we can send email to be slightly more than 500 miles. Â There are a number of destinations within that radius that we can&rsquo;t reach, either, or reach sporadically, but we can never email farther than this radius.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; I said, and put my head in my hands. Â &quot;When did this start? Â A<br/>\nfew days ago, you said, but did anything change in your systems at that<br/>\ntime?&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, the consultant came in and patched our server and rebooted it.<br/>\nBut I called him, and he said he didn&rsquo;t touch the mail system.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Okay, let me take a look, and I&rsquo;ll call you back,&rdquo; I said, scarcely<br/>\nbelieving that I was playing along. Â It wasn&rsquo;t April Fool&rsquo;s Day. Â I tried<br/>\nto remember if someone owed me a practical joke.</p>\n\n<p>I logged into their department&rsquo;s server, and sent a few test mails. Â This<br/>\nwas in the Research Triangle of North Carolina, and a test mail to my own account was delivered without a hitch. Â Ditto for one sent to Richmond, and Atlanta, and Washington. Â Another to Princeton (400 miles) worked.</p>\n\n<p>But then I tried to send an email to Memphis (600 miles). Â It failed.<br/>\nBoston, failed. Â Detroit, failed. Â I got out my address book and started<br/>\ntrying to narrow this down. Â New York (420 miles) worked, but Providence (580 miles) failed.</p>\n\n<p>I was beginning to wonder if I had lost my sanity. Â I tried emailing a<br/>\nfriend who lived in North Carolina, but whose ISP was in Seattle.<br/>\nThankfully, it failed. Â If the problem had had to do with the geography of the human recipient and not his mail server, I think I would have broken down in tears.</p>",
