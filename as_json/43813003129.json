Maybe I only think that because the good liars donât get caught? But a lot of people are just awful at it. They make their âIâm lying now!â faces and they tell stories that defy physics, biology, and logic, then forget their own stories.</p>\n<p>And a lie I hear almost every day in the emergency room is âI fell down the stairs.Â My partner loves me. They would never hurt me.â</p>\n<p><em>(In this post, I will be mixing up genders randomly in the examples, to illustrate that members of every gender abuse members of every gender. This is not the post to talk about âwho does it more/who does it worse.â)</em></p>\n<p>For a long time, I just couldnât understand this. Weâd get the victim in a private room locked away from the abuser, and theyâd sit there with bruises or wounds or even broken bones, in a safe place surrounded by people who wanted to help them, and theyâd tell us, often through tears ââ¦I fell down the stairs.â It drove me nuts. It made me furious at the victims. Why did they do this? Did they like pain? Did they want to get murdered? Were they just unbelievably stupid? Why would someone choose to protect and return to a partner who just broke their arm?</p>\n<p>Well, then I worked in the ER a little longer, talked to a lot more abuse victims and survivors, and it turns out thereâs a lot of reasons. Iâm sure this isnât comprehensive, but Iâm going to make a long list here - and often many of these reasons are working together. Some of them are deeply wrapped up in the psychology of abuse; some of them are just depressingly sensible. Each of these is based on a real person, or several of them are based on one real person - most of them are based on many real people.</p>\n<p><strong>1. âI donât want to die.â</strong></p>\n<p>Her husband has told her that if she leaves he will kill her, and she believes this. (She may well be right.) The instant he gets a whiff of where sheâs staying - and he probably will, at some point, from a well-meaning friend or through the legal system or by persistent stalking or random chance - heâs going to come there and heâs going to do something very, very bad to her. Staying with him may be horrible, but at least she gets to live. She believes that if she leaves, no one and nothing can protect her from his vengeance.</p>\n<p><strong>2. âIâll die without her.â</strong></p>\n<p>He lives in his girlfriendâs apartment. Heâs unemployed, or minimally employed, and has no education or good experience on his resume. He has no friends besides her. Heâs gotten to the point where he doesnât know how heâll get food without her help, much less navigate all the challenges of life. And if he leaves her, heâll be leaving everything - sheâll destroy any of his stuff that he leaves behind, stalk him so he canât stay at the same job, and even kill his pets. If he leaves her, heâs certain that heâll end up living on the streets.</p>\n<p><strong>3. âHeâll die without me.â</strong></p>\n<p>Her boyfriend lives in her apartment. Heâs unemployed, or minimally employed. He probably doesnât know how to get food without her help, much less navigate all the challenges of life. He tells her heâd be homeless without her, maybe even kill himself if she left him. She just couldnât stand to be responsible for something like that; even though heâs hurt her, it would cut her to the bone to know that she had ruined or killed him.</p>\n<p><strong>4.âWhat about the kids?â</strong></p>\n<p>Right now, she protects the kids from her husband. He may rage at her, but she shelters them from the worst of it and she makes sure they have the best home she can give them under the circumstances. If she leaves, she doubts she can get sole custody of the kids without visitation, much less get it immediately. And if the kids are alone with him, something very bad will happen. Heâll hurt them, or turn them against her, or take them away and sheâll never see them again. Maybe all three. Her kids are her life and she canât bear to let something like that happen.</p>\n<p><strong>5. âI tried once, and it made things worse.â</strong></p>\n<p>This isnât the first time. He did call the cops on his husband before, and he ran away that night. The cops didnât find enough evidence, and when he came back to get his stuff, his husband wasâ¦ tearfully apologetic, actually. Somehow he talked him into staying and not taking his stuff. The punishment came laterâonce heâd more or less committed to staying around - and it was horrible. But heâs afraid that if he tried to leave again, heâd go through the same cycle again.</p>\n<p><strong>6. âI reached out once, and was rebuffed.â</strong></p>\n<p>In a rare moment of courage, he - with shaking hands, summoning all his strength - told someone he thought he could trust what his wife was doing to him. They told him to think about her point of view for once, to not use big drastic words like âabuse,â and to take care of his own damn problems without airing his dirty laundry. He just knows that if he reaches out again, itâs going to be the same thing. Heâs lucky she didnât find out about that time and doubts if itâs worth taking the risk again.</p>\n<p><strong>7. âIf I call the cops, Iâll be in trouble.â</strong></p>\n<p>Sheâs a prostitute. On the side, she sells drugs. She owns guns she shouldnât have and lives in a place she shouldnât be. Hell, she shouldnât even be in this country. Her lifestyle is so far outside the law that any attention from the police is likely to get her thrown in jail - so she canât very well tell the police that her girlfriend beats her.</p>\n<p><strong>8. âRun away? Call the cops? I canât even get away with sneezing!â</strong></p>\n<p>Her boyfriend controls every second of her time and every inch she moves. Whenever theyâre apart she has to call him and check in constantly; whenever she leaves the house she has to tell him where sheâs going and how long and why; he doesnât let her think without telling him about it and getting his approval. And he enforces this - reading her mail, listening to her phone conversations, showing up randomly at her work or when sheâs with friends (if sheâs allowed to have any). When sheâs not allowed so small a rebellion as using the wrong word, really rebelling against him seems impossible. She figures heâd catch her if she even thought about trying.</p>\n<p><strong>9. âIf it were so bad, someone would have done something.</strong>â</p>\n<p>Everyone knows whatâs going on in his life. His friends have seen his girlfriend hitting him; his parents have heard him say âI canât do that, she wonât let meâ about a million things; the neighbors have heard the screams and crashes when she explodes. He knows everyone knows already, and knows that they havenât done anything even though they know. So, he figures, what difference would it make to tell them? Clearly theyâve already decided that this isnât bad enough to call in the authorities over.</p>\n<p><strong>10. âItâs a joke to him, so it should be a joke to me.â</strong></p>\n<p>His boyfriend hits him and treats it like a joke, laughing uproariously and expecting his victim to laugh along. To make a big deal out of this kind of violence would just be humorless, and heâs got a sense of humor, doesnât he? Even when the only punchline is âHaha, youâre in pain!â And how do you go to the cops with a story like âHe played a joke on me?â Cops donât arrest people for jokes.</p>\n<p><strong>11. âIâm just terrified to hurt her feelings.â</strong></p>\n<p>Abuse has made her telepathic. Years of desperately trying to keep her girlfriend happy so bad things wonât happen have made her keenly aware of her girlfriendâs every fleeting emotion. Her girlfriend is a tiny bit moody and she rushes to coddle and comfort her; her girlfriend is a tiny bit happy and she just about throws a party for her. Sheâs so used to reading her girlfriendâs feelings and translating them into her own that she canât stand to do something that would really hurt her girlfriendâs feelings. Just the thought of dealing with that much anger - when even a tiny amount of anger is a big deal in their house - is too terrifying to imagine.</p>\n<p><strong>12. âIâm so embarrassed I let him do this to me.â</strong></p>\n<p>Heâs been abusing her for years. She doesnât see herself as some cowed little victim; sheâs a smart woman, an independent woman to all appearances, maybe even a declared feminist. So to come out now and say heâs been hurting her all along just feels stupid. Everyoneâs going to ask âWhy did you stay with that jerk?â and sheâs not going to have an answer. She tells everyone her relationship is wonderful and a paragon of communication and respect, and the longer she keeps up the charade, the harder it is to say not only âTurns out Iâm a cowed little victim,â but âTurns out Iâm a cowed little victim and also a liar.â</p>\n<p><strong>13. âIâve learned to live in her system.â</strong></p>\n<p>He knows all the rules by now. As long as he always treats his wife with the utmost politeness and gentleness, and always has dinner ready before she comes home, always is up for sex when she wants it, and always lets her make the decisions, things are okay. He actually feels pretty safe when heâs being âgood.â So it doesnât seem like thereâs anything wrong with the relationship, because it goes great so long as he does as heâs supposed to.</p>\n<p><strong>14. âWeâre outsiders; no one cares about our problems.â</strong></p>\n<p>Theyâre a âlesbian coupleâ, one of them is transgender, and theyâre kinky to boot. Sheâs had enough problems just explaining to the âauthoritiesâ that their relationship exists; how the hell is she supposed to convey that thereâs something wrong with it? Sheâs internalized enough prejudice that she figures itâs sort of her own fault for being in such a strange relationship, and she doesnât figure anyone cares that much about the troubles of a weirdo.</p>\n<p><strong>15. âAfter all heâs done for a jerk like me?â</strong></p>\n<p>Her husband has put up with so much from her. This isnât #13; these were genuinely bad things. He helped her pay off the nasty credit card debt she was in. He stayed with her even after she got fired from her job and flunked out of school; he even bailed her out of jail when she really fucked up. Who could blame the guy if he loses his patience now and then? She figures she really is a very difficult person to live with, she deserves some punishment for all sheâs screwed up, and she should be grateful that heâs kept her around at all. As he reminds her when sheâs pushed him too far - who else would love her?</p>\n<p><strong>16. âSheâs really niceâ¦ mostly.â</strong></p>\n<p>Her wife is super sweet and loving. Sheâs a flowers-and-chocolates romantic, a believer in true love and love at first sight, and she treats her just like a princess. Except now and then, things get tense in the relationship, and bad things happen. Really bad things. Her wife just doesnât seem like herself and she explodes. But the apology is even sweeter and lovinger than before and things are good again. Maybe it was a one-off. Or a two-off. A three-off? Maybe this really is the last time and from now on sheâll just have the nice wife she fell in love with. Sheâs certainly being nice now, and how could you leave someone like that?</p>\n<p><strong>17. âIt just isnât done in our community.â</strong></p>\n<p>In her culture, the husband is the leader of the household and what he says, goes. He has the right to hit his wife if he feels itâs necessary. Divorce is a taboo. Good women donât leave their husbands; good women make their husbands happy. She feels like going against her husband would be going against her entire culture, and she canât bear to do that. The community wouldnât support her and sheâd feel like a traitor to her own people.</p>\n<p><strong>18. âActually, Iâm abusing her.â</strong></p>\n<p>When she explodes, she doesnât tell her boyfriend âI hate you;â she tells him âyou hate me.â She tells him that heâs hurting her, that sheâs responding the way she is because she just canât take his abuse any more, and he believes her. Heâs trying desperately to treat her right, to treat her the way she deserves, and he just keeps fucking up. Often when sheâs yelling he yells back - sometimes he even hits back - and that makes him more sure than ever that heâs the real abuser here.</p>\n<p><strong>19. âItâs not that bad.â</strong></p>\n<p>She firmly believes that real abuse is when they punch you - and her husbandâs only slapped her with an open hand. Real abuse is when they beat you - and he only yells at her until she cries and then yells at her to stop crying. Real abuse is when they rape you - and he always makes her say âyesâ before he has sex with her, no matter how little she wants it. She recognizes thereâs something wrong in their relationship, but could never call it like, abuse abuse, and so she canât react to it like itâs real abuse.</p>\n<p><strong>20. âThis is how relationships work, isnât it?â</strong></p>\n<p>Her parentsâ relationship was a constant cycle of drama and violence. Her relationship with her parents was just as bad. Her high school boyfriend hit her and her college boyfriend made her have sex when she didnât want it. She kinda figures everyone elseâs relationship is just the same behind the scenes. All she worries about is how to make the best of an abusive relationship; while she knows it intellectually, she doesnât believe deep down that a non-abusive relationship is possible, at least for her.</p>\n<p>The one thing that isnât on the list, anywhere, is âthe victim is just weak and stupid.â Victims of abuse come in all types and lots of them really are flawed in big and small ways - but their reasons for staying with their abusers are not âjust stupid.â Theyâre complicated, insidious, and saddest of all, sometimes right.</p>\n<p>If any of these sound like you - even if they sound like you in a âYeah, butâ¦â sort of way - even if your partner never laid a finger on you physically, it was just some yelling - even if youâre a man and sheâs a woman and it doesnât work like that - even if you swear your situation isnât abuse because - call this number:</p>\n<p><strong>1â800â799âSAFE(7233)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TTY: 1â800â787â3224</strong></p>\n<p>Itâs the National Domestic Violence Hotline and they will talk to you. They are not going to call the cops on your partner (or you). They are not going to tell you that you have to leave your relationship. Calling them is not a commitment of any kind - you can always call them and decide to stay in your relationship after all. All theyâre going to do is talk to you, give you an outside perspective from people who are trained to recognize and deal with abusive situations, and help you find resources for getting out of your situation if you decide that you want them.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I volunteer a couple times a month taking calls for my local rape victim advocacy program, and since domestic violence and rape often go hand in hand, we do get calls from people in abusive situations as well. If youâre not ready to leave, we can help you make a safety plan for staying. We have legal and medical resources, as well as places for you to stay for a while if you do choose to leave. Thereâs absolutely no judgment about your decisions - our job is to listen to you, and to help you figure out what <em>you</em> want to or can do.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>reblogging because always relevant</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>",
