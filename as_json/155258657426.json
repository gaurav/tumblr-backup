Alan Moore claims that clues to identity of VÂ âare all thereâ, which implies it might be a named character. If it was one, the only person matching would be Valerie, the woman whose journals V gives to Evey. Everything would match - Valerie was an actress, which would fit with both costume and tastes of V, and also why said letter was so important - and really, how the hell an occupant of a high-security concentration camp under constant observation had ability to write a letter, and also how a letter written on toiler paper would survive all these years, and burning down of Larkhill camp. (answer - by being written AFTER all these events).</p>\n<p>Except, V appears to be male. Everyone is using male pronouns for him, in the movie he speaks in a masculine voice, and in the novel we do see a panel of his silhouette naked in Larkhill, and he definitely has a masculine physique.</p>\n<p>But, if Valerie becoming V was metaphor for transition, thatâd make sense.</p>\n<p>\n\nThatâs in addition to well, the fact that a lot of trans men begin their self-discovery as butch lesbians? Itâd sure fit.<br/></p>\n<p>Why do I believe that theory? In addition to whole LGBT themes thing, and the letter thing, thereâs one more reason. Well, I think this was skimmed by in the movie, but in the novel, we get a pretty solid clue. See, in the movie, exact nature of experiments performed on Larkhill inmates is kept rather dubious if I recall - we know they gave V abilities slightly above normal humans, but thatâs it.</p>\n<p>But in the novel, itâs more specific. So, what is the field of experiments that are being performed Larkhill concentration camp that they needed human specimen?</p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"557\" data-orig-height=\"448\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/27ba429d21021168510e902a74b5cef1/tumblr_inline_og96al5fbs1rqx6t1_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"557\" data-orig-height=\"448\" alt=\"image\"/></figure><p>Hormone research.</p>\n<p>V got strength to throw off chains of opression and fight back and yadda yadda, became a character who ticks off literally every single checkbox on definition of a superhero, including superpowersâ¦</p>\n<p><i>By literal<b> fucking</b> hormone therapy.</i></p>\n<p><i>Administered to him, ironically, by the very oppressors.</i></p>\n<p>From what Iâve read of Alan Mooreâs stories, he doesnât leave details up to a chance. Everything has a reason, and everything is interconnected with each other. And this, this doesnât look like a bit of dark irony Alan Moore would pass up, since he loves that shit.<br/></p>\n<p>So, those are my reasons for this particular interpretation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>both the wachowskis are openly trans women now but yesÂ </p>\n</blockquote>",
