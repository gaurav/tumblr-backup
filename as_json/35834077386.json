   "quote-text" : "<p>And yet, if all of the Americans killed in 911 and all of their families could speak to this dynamic, what do you think they would say? Yes, the price of greatness is responsibility and no sacrifice is too great, and no individual so unexpendable, that we must keep the head of counterterrorism doing his job. Fire his womanizing ass. Or, would they say, who gives a damn who this guy screws or why? He made the Cole case. He supervised the embassies investigation. He went to Pakistan to arrest the man who shot up the CIA headquarters in Langley. He&rsquo;s the best we have in counterterrorism. Let him do his damn job. And while weâre at it, let Winston Churchill, the greatest wartime leader of the century, drink whatever the hell he wants in as much quantity as he can manage, as long as he continues to lead this country as he does.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t need rectitude from my leaders. I need competence. I need results. If you have someone better than Petraeus, then that&rsquo;s one thing. If he&rsquo;s the best at counterinsurgency, then he is not expendable at this time, when insurgency and our response to it mean actual American lives in the balance.</p>",
