   "quote-text" : "<p>Ants responded to a fall by spreading all their appendages wide and waiting until they jammed to a stop. &ldquo;One of the coolest things we found was that fire ants used their antennae to brace themselves,&rdquo; Gravish says. While falling, the ants turned these delicate sensors into extra load-bearing limbs.</p>\n\n<p>When the glass tube width increased to 1.3 times the ants&rsquo; body length, the strategy began to fail. The tunnels ants built themselves had an average diameter of just 1.06 times their body length, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/05/16/1302428110.abstract\">the authors report in PNAS</a> [link moved by me]. It seems fire ants put most of the responsibility for stopping falls on the tunnels themselves. After that, all a plummeting insect has to do is stretch out its limbs.</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>This strategy could inspire how we design robots for confined spaces such as search-and-rescue zones, Gravish says. For instance, &ldquo;falling is usually considered a failure mode for a robot.&rdquo; But fire ants seem to use little falls to descend more quickly through their tunnels. If engineers knew the size of the cracks and crevices in a disaster area, they might be able to send in many inexpensive robots designed to tumble through those spaces &ndash; rather than one very expensive robot built to keep its footing.</p>",
