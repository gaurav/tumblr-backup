   "quote-text" : "<p>[Barack Obama] shook his head. He doesnât watch cable news, which he thinks is genuinely toxic. One of his aides told me that once, thinking the president otherwise occupied, heâd made the mistake of switching the Air Force One television from ESPN, which Obama prefers, to a cable news show. The president walked into the room and watched a talking head explain knowingly to his audience why he, Obama, had taken some action. âOh, so thatâs why I did it,â said Obama, and walked out.</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>The president may not have been surprised that the Pentagon hadnât sought to answer [the question of how to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Benghazi#Battle\">defend the people of Benghazi against a Gaddafi-lead attack</a>]. He was nevertheless visibly annoyed. âI donât know why we are even having this meeting,â he said, or words to that effect. âYouâre telling me a no-fly zone doesnât solve the problem, but the only option youâre giving me is a no-fly zone.â He gave his generals two hours to come up with another solution for him to consider, then left to attend the next event on his schedule, a ceremonial White House dinner.</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>âBy the time I go to the second meeting Iâm viewing the choices differently,â says Obama. âI know that Iâm definitely not doing a no-fly zone. Because I think itâs just a show to protect backsides, politically.â In his Nobel speech heâd argued that in cases such as these the United States should not act alone. âIn these situations we should have a bias towards operating multilaterally,â he says. â<strong>Because the very process of building a coalition forces you to ask tough questions. You may think you are acting morally, but you may be fooling yourself</strong>.â</p>",
