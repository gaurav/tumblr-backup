One day they may seem fine, and the next they are sad, distant and may push you away. It is important that you know that as a person who is close to them and trusted by them, you can help your friend or partner have shorter, less severe bouts of depression. Mental illness is as real as physical illness (it is physical actually, read more about that<a href=\"http://www.thedarlingbakers.com/healing-depression-with-herbs/\">Â here</a>) and your partner needs you as much as they would need to be cared for if they had the flu.</p>\n<p>Your relationship may seem one-sided during these times, but by helping your partner through a very difficult and painful affliction, you are strengthening your relationship and their mental health in the long term.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. Help them keep clutter at bay.</strong></h2>\n<p>WhenÂ a person begins spiraling into depression, they may feel like they are slowing down while the world around them speeds up. The mail may end up in stacks, dishes can pile up in the sink, laundry may go undone as the depressed person begins to feel more and more overwhelmed by their daily routine and unable to keep up. By giving your partner some extra help sorting mail, washing dishes or using paper plates and keeping chaos in check in general, youâll be giving them (and yourself) the gift of a calmÂ  environment. (Iâm a fan of the minimalist movement because of this, you can read more about that<a href=\"http://www.thedarlingbakers.com/tag/minimalism/\">Â here</a>.)</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Fix them a healthy meal.</strong></h2>\n<p>Your partner may do one of two things when they are in a depressed state. They may eat very little, or they may overeat. In either case, they may find that driving through a fast food restaurant or ordering a pizza online is just easier than fixing a meal. Eating like this, or neglecting to eat will only degrade your partnerâs health, causing them to go deeper into their depression. Help your loved one keep their body healthy, and their mind will follow.Â <a href=\"http://www.maryvancenc.com/2013/12/overcome-depression-naturally/\">This is a great articleÂ </a>that talks about the âBrain Dietâ which can help the symptoms of depression, andÂ <a href=\"http://ancestral-nutrition.com/why-your-ancestors-didnt-have-anxiety-or-depression-and-you-do/\">this articleÂ </a>talks about how our modern diet could contribute to the recentÂ rise in depression.<a href=\"http://www.thedarlingbakers.com/mood-boosting-trail-mix-recipe/\">Â HereÂ </a>is a recipe for a trail mix that is quick to make and has mood-boosting properties.</p>\n<h2><strong>3.Get them outside.</strong></h2>\n<p>Â The benefits of getting outside for a depressed person are huge. And it is possibly the last thing on earth your partner will want to do. Take them to be somewhere in nature. Pack a picnic and lie in the sun, take a leisurely hike or plant a garden. Being barefoot in the dirt, or â<a href=\"http://yogimami.com/Empire/earthing/\">earthing</a>â helps ground the body and reverse the effects of living in a world of emfâs, and digging in soil can actually act as an antidepressant, as a strain of bacterium in soil,Â <em>Mycobacterium vaccae</em>, triggers the release of seratonin, which in turn elevates mood and decreases anxiety. Sunshine increasesÂ <a href=\"http://loulanatural.com/vitamin-d/\">Vitamin D production</a>Â which can helpÂ <a href=\"http://realfitmama.org/blog/2013/12/19/10-signs-your-kid-is-vitamin-d-deficient\">alleviate depression</a>. My friend Elizabeth wrote an excellent post about Vitamin D and its link to depressionÂ <a href=\"http://www.livingthenourishedlife.com/2014/01/vitamin-d-depression-children\">here.Â </a>Â For more information about other sources of Vitamin D,<a href=\"http://www.cheeseslave.com/top-10-best-sources-of-vitamin-d/\">Â this is a great post</a>Â as well asÂ <a href=\"http://gutsybynature.com/2013/09/18/vitamin-d-crohns-disease-paleo-lifestyle-can-help/\">this.</a></p>\n<h2><strong>4. Ask them to help you understand what theyâre feeling.</strong></h2>\n<p>If your partner is able to articulate what they are going through, it will help them and you better understand what you are dealing with, and may give insight into a plan of action for helping your partner. Also, feeling alone is common for a depressed person and anything that combats that feeling will help alleviate the severity and length of the depression.</p>\n<h2><strong>5. Encourage them to focus on self-care.</strong></h2>\n<p>Depressed people often stop taking care of themselves. Showering, getting haircuts, going to the doctor or dentist, itâs all just too hard, and they donât deserve to be well taken care of anyway in their minds. This can snowball quickly into greater feelings of worthlessness since âNow Iâm such a mess, no one could ever love meâ. Help your loved one by being proactive. Tell them âIâm going to do the dishes, why donât you go enjoy a bubble bath?â can give them the permission they wonât give themselves to do something normal, healthy and self-loving.</p>\n<h2><strong>6. Hug them.</strong></h2>\n<p>Studies show that a sincere hug that lasts longer than 20 seconds can release feel-good chemicals in the brain and elevate the mood of the giver and receiver. Depressed people often donât want to be touched, but a sincere hug with no expectation of anything further can give your partner a lift.</p>\n<h2><strong>7. Laugh with them.</strong></h2>\n<p>Telling a silly joke, watching a comedy or seeing a stand up comedian will encourage your partner to laugh in spite of themselves. Laughing releases endorphins and studies show can actually counteract symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p>\n<h2><strong>8. Reassure them that you can handle their feelings.</strong></h2>\n<p>Your partner may be feeling worthless, angry and even guilty while they are depressed. They may be afraid that they will end up alone because no one will put up with their episodes forever. Reassure them that you are in the relationship for the long haul and they wonât scare you away because they have an illness.</p>\n<h2><strong>9. Challenge theirÂ destructive thoughts.</strong></h2>\n<p>A depressed personâs mind can be a never-ending loop of painful, destructive thoughts. âIâm unlovable, Iâm a failure, Iâm ugly, Iâm stupidâ. Challenge these untruths with the truth. âYouâre not unlovable, I love you. You arenât a failure, here are all the things youâve accomplished.â</p>\n<h2><strong>10.Remind them why you love them.</strong></h2>\n<p>Look at pictures of happy times youâve had together. Tell them your favorite things about them. Reminisce about your relationship and all the positive things that have happened, and remind your partner that you love them and they will get through this.</p>\n<p>(via <a href=\"http://www.thedarlingbakers.com/love-someone-with-depression/\">The Darling Bakers</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More people need to know this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div>This is so incredibly important. Iâve seen people with depression ostracized so many times, and I cannot stress how much it means to each and every person Iâve tried to reach out to after whatever âfalling-outsâ theyâve had due to depression. Remember to always be compassionate and kind to all friends like this, because you never know what theyâre going through.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is really really really fucking important and hits so close to home itâs not even funny. Also, please keep in mind that if youâre depressed and the person you love wonât do these things for whatever stupid reason,Â <em>then fucking leave them</em>. Youâre worth so much more than that and itâs a goddamn waste of your time to maintain meaningless relationships with selfish people.</p></blockquote>",
