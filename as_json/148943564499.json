Ain&rsquo;t it the cutest?</i></h5>\nA mouse took a stroll through the deep dark wood.<br/>\nA fox saw the mouse, and the mouse looked good.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Where are you going to, little brown mouse?<br/>\nCome and have lunch in my underground house.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terribly kind of you, Fox, but no â<br/>\nI&rsquo;m going to have lunch with a gruffalo.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;A gruffalo?  What&rsquo;s a gruffalo?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;A gruffalo!  Why, didn&rsquo;t you know?<br/><br/>\nHe has terrible tusks, and terrible claws,<br/>\nAnd terrible teeth in his terrible jaws.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Where are you meeting him?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Here, by these rocks,<br/>\nAnd his favourite food is roasted fox.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Roasted fox!  I&rsquo;m off!&rdquo; Fox said.<br/>\n&ldquo;Goodbye, little mouse,&rdquo; and away he sped.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Silly old Fox!  Doesn&rsquo;t he know,<br/>\nThere&rsquo;s no such thing as a gruffalo?&rdquo;<br/><br/>\nOn went the mouse through the deep dark wood.<br/>\nAn owl saw the mouse, and the mouse looked good.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Where are you going to, little brown mouse?<br/>\nCome and have tea in my treetop house.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terribly kind of you, Owl, but no â<br/>\nI&rsquo;m going to have tea with a gruffalo.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;A gruffalo?  What&rsquo;s a gruffalo?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;A gruffalo!  Why, didn&rsquo;t you know?<br/><br/>\nHe has knobbly knees, and turned-out toes,<br/>\nAnd a poisonous wart at the end of his nose.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Where are you meeting him?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Here, by this stream,<br/>\nAnd his favourite food is owl ice cream.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Owl ice cream!

What&rsquo;s a gruffalo?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;A gruffalo!  Why, didn&rsquo;t you know?<br/><br/>\nHis eyes are orange, his tongue is black,<br/>\nHe has purple prickles all over his back.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Where are you meeting him?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Here, by this lake,<br/>\nAnd his favourite food is scrambled snake.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Scrambled snake!  It&rsquo;s time I hid!&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Goodbye, little mouse,&rdquo; and away Snake slid.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Silly old Owl!  Doesn&rsquo;t he know,<br/>\nThere&rsquo;s no such thing as a gruffal&hellip;?&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&hellip;OH!&ldquo;<br/><br/>\nBut who is this creature with terrible claws<br/>\nAnd terrible teeth in his terrible jaws?<br/>\nHe has knobbly knees, and turned-out toes,<br/>\nAnd a poisonous wart at the end of his nose.<br/>\nHis eyes are orange, his tongue is black,<br/>\nHe has purple prickles all over his back.<br/><br/>\n&quot;Oh help!  Oh no!<br/>\nIt&rsquo;s a gruffalo!&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;My favourite food!&rdquo; the Gruffalo said.<br/>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll taste good on a slice of bread!&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Good?&rdquo; said the mouse.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me good!<br/>\nI&rsquo;m the scariest creature in this wood.<br/>\nJust walk behind me and soon you&rsquo;ll see,<br/>\nEveryone is afraid of me.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Gruffalo, bursting with laughter.<br/>\n&ldquo;You go ahead and I&rsquo;ll follow after.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\nThey walked and walked till the Gruffalo said,<br/>\n&ldquo;I hear a hiss in the leaves ahead.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Snake,&rdquo; said the mouse.  &ldquo;Why, Snake, hello!&rdquo;<br/>\nSnake took one look at the Gruffalo.<br/>\n&ldquo;Oh crumbs!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Goodbye, little mouse!&rdquo;<br/>\nAnd off he slid to his logpile house.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; said the mouse.  &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Amazing!&rdquo; said the Gruffalo.<br/><br/>\nThey walked some more till the Gruffalo said,<br/>\n&ldquo;I hear a hoot in the trees ahead.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Owl,&rdquo; said the mouse.  &ldquo;Why, Owl, hello!&rdquo;<br/>\nOwl took one look at the Gruffalo.<br/>\n&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Goodbye, little mouse!&rdquo;<br/>\nAnd off he flew to his treetop house.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; said the mouse.  &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Astounding!&rdquo; said the Gruffalo.<br/><br/>\nThey walked some more till the Gruffalo said,<br/>\n&ldquo;I can hear feet on the path ahead.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Fox,&rdquo; said the mouse.  &ldquo;Why, Fox, hello!&rdquo;<br/>\nFox took one look at the Gruffalo.<br/>\n&ldquo;Oh help!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Goodbye, little mouse!&rdquo;<br/>\nAnd off he ran to his underground house.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Well, Gruffalo,&rdquo; said the mouse.  &ldquo;You see?<br/>\nEveryone is afraid of me!<br/>\nBut now my tummy&rsquo;s beginning to rumble.<br/>\nMy favourite food is â gruffalo crumble!&rdquo;<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Gruffalo crumble!&rdquo; the Gruffalo said,<br/>\nAnd quick as the wind he turned and fled.<br/><br/>\nAll was quiet in the deep dark wood.<br/>\nThe mouse found a nut and the nut was good.<br/><div align=\"right\">&ndash; Julia Donaldson</div>",
