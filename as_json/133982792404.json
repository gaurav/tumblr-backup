Chances are it was in a bulk upload from the <a href=\"http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/2421592\">Whio Forever</a> project in New Zealand. But we do know that when Erick Noe Tapia Banda (<a href=\"http://www.inaturalist.org/people/momoto-erick\">@momoto-erick</a>) uploaded this beautiful <a href=\"http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/2421618\">Tropical Kingbird observation from Oaxaca Mexico</a> at 2:59 PM Oaxaca time the count was 1,999,994.</p>\n<img src=\"http://static.inaturalist.org/photos/2696713/large.JPG?1448398845\"/><p>And 25 seconds later when Kim Hyun-tae (<a href=\"http://www.inaturalist.org/people/pintail\">@pintail</a>) posted this great photo of an <a href=\"http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/2421647\">Eastern Spot-billed Duck from South Chungcheong Province, South Korea</a> the count was 2,000,037.</p>\n<img src=\"http://static.inaturalist.org/photos/2696716/original.jpg?1448398848\"/><p>\nLast year, I blogged about <a href=\"http://inaturalist.tumblr.com/post/102260888368/what-does-one-million-nature-observations-look\">iNaturalistâs one millionth observation</a>, which we reached on November 7th, 2014. While it took ~6.5 years for iNaturalist to reach its first million observations (2,422 days) it took just about a year (382 days) to reach its second. Ken-ichiâs post <a href=\"http://inaturalist.tumblr.com/post/133346901714/while-we-do-a-decent-job-showing-observations-in\">from last week</a> includes a cool video that shows this increase in the rate of new iNat observations over the history of the site.</p>\n<p>\nAs for this most recent million observations over these past 382 day, they came in an average of 2,617 each day or 1 observation every 33 seconds. About 81% are candidates to become <a href=\"http://inaturalist.tumblr.com/post/126691814973/changes-to-quality-grade\">research quality observations</a> (meaning they have locations, photos, and are of wild organisms) and so far about 42% have become research quality (meaning they are candidates that also have community consensus around their identifications).</p>\n<p>Plants followed by birds and then insects <a href=\"http://inaturalist.tumblr.com/post/76391191046/12-a-million-observations\">continue to be</a> the taxonomic categories with the most observations. You can see a finer breakdown of the taxonomic categories that observations on iNaturalist fall into in this <a href=\"http://bost.ocks.org/mike/sankey/\">Sankey diagram</a>:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://loarie.github.io/Sankey3.html\" width=\"520\" height=\"825\"></iframe></p>\n<p>I hope everyone reading this from the US has a Happy Thanksgiving and that everyone, no matter where you are, gets a chance to get outside and explore the changing seasons!</p>\n<p>\n-Scott\n</p></blockquote>",
