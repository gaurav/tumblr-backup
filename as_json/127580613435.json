But heâs a Slytherin- heâs been dealing with this shit since he got sorted, so he keeps his head high and joins the other champions.</p><p>Imagine Harry trying to catch Warrington alone because he doesnât really want to associate with Slytherins (plus Malfoy has this tendency of being around the guy ALL THE TIME since he got chosen), but at the same time heâs also fair enough not to want him to walk into the first task unprepared.</p><p>Imagine Warrington walking over to Harry a few months later, and Ron and Hermione both jump into a protective stance, wands out, but instead of attacking Harry he just tells him to stick the egg underwater. (Because Slytherins donât forget those who helped them out).</p><p>Imagine Warrington and Harry helping each other out in the labyrinth.</p><p>Imagine Harry being devastated when Peter kills Warrington- because Voldemort doesnât care what house theyâre form, a spare is a spare.</p><p>Imagine the uproar that causes among the Slytherins, because some of their parents really <i>are</i> Death Eaters and they know what really happened.</p><p>Imagine Slytherins fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts and shoutingÂ âThis is for Cassius!â</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Imagine Harry returning with Warringtonâs body, and the crowd realizes whatâs happened, but Warringtonâs parents donât show up. Thereâs no one to mourn him, to cradle him in their arms and cry for their son. The Slytherins know why. His parents were Death Eaters, too.</p><p>Imagine Slytherins reaching out, asking for help from classmates from other houses. Theyâre terrified, truly terrified because the being their parents claimed would never hurt them because theyâre pureblood, they realize that <i>he does not care</i>.</p><p>Imagine Slytherins in the 5th book sneaking off to join Dumbledoreâs Army, to learn more about who Voldemort is without their parents acting as a filter.Â </p><p>Imagine the shock when theyâre told what heâs <i>really</i> done.</p><p>Imagine that a few talented Slytherins went with Harry and the others into the Ministry of Magic. The others are a bit wary but they prove themselves as friends.</p><p>Imagine them being confronted by Lucius Malfoy in the the Hall of Prophecy, and when the Death Eaters descend, they know that any one of them could be their parents.</p><p>Imagine the shocked gasp of a Death Eater as they realize their own child, a pureblood, is standing defiantly with Harry Potter. They choke back a cry. They canât let their child know that they were about to duel to the death.</p><p>Imagine a DA Slytherin facing off against their own Death Eater parent. That they make the decision to let their child defeat them, because in that moment, they realize that they love their child more than they fear Voldemort. They go down, mask unveiled, and the Slytherin kid has to be dragged from the fight before he gets killed.</p><p>Imagine Book 6 Slytherins getting more friendly and cooperative with the other houses. Two years of Voldemort terrorizing the muggle and Wizarding world, two years where their parents just up and leave some days, cringing from the pain in their arm, two years after the death of the first Slytherin pureblood, Cassius Warrington, killed by Voldemortâs right-hand man, and theyâre slowly hitting the breaking point.</p><p>Imagine Slytherin kids keeping tabs on their parents, sending the information to Harry, who shares it with the Order of the Phoenix, and hoping that their parents wonât be killed.</p><p>Imagine Book 7 Slytherins low-key rebelling against the new oppressive Hogwarts staff.</p><p>Imagine the final seige on Hogwarts, where Slytherins stand proudly by their fellow houses, knowing full-well they could be fighting their own parents. Some Slytherins <i>know</i>Â their parents were in the fighting. They hope to find them first and sneak them away. Their fellow students understand. Professor McGonagall allows 7th Year Slytherin, Pansy Parkinson, to duel a death eater in her stead; her father is under that veil. She knows it.</p><p>Imagine the aftermath of the battle; every house suffered losses. Slytherin students crying over the deaths of friends they made in every house.</p><p>Imagine \n\n a Cassius Warrington statue made in his honor, the first Slytherin to fight and die nobly with Harry Potter, the boy who lived, in the face of ultimate evil. He was a true Slytherin, and itâs in his name that Slytherin children and their families have cut all ties with the Death Eaters, denounced Voldemort, and are finally living in peace.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Whoa though, holy shit.</p></blockquote>",
