Let me know if you want to visit. Bring snacks.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh yeah, also bring books. I canât seem to be able to read lately (usually reading is my #1 form of escape). I need something thatâs easy to dive in to, I need some mindless, yet entertaining trash fiction. Please, tell me your guilty pleasures. Who knows, maybe we can secretly talk about it later.</p></blockquote>\n\nWhen I&rsquo;m stressed, I like re-reading my favorites. I think a good Terry Pratchett novel is a guilty pleasure for me: I don&rsquo;t love &lsquo;em in the way I love a Douglas Adams or a Jasper Fforde, but a really good one &ndash; <em>Reaper Man</em>, <em>Carpe Jugulum</em>, <em>The Fifth Elephant</em>, <em>Thud</em> &ndash; keeps you gripped from start to finish. I haven&rsquo;t read a Wodehouse novel in a while, but I think they can be equally distracting too. Oh, and <em>The Shadow of the Wind</em> is a pretty gripping young adult novel that does that thing of being a novel that only really works as a novel, if you want to remind yourself what novels can do that audio or video can&rsquo;t.",
