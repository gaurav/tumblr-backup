   "quote-text" : "In July 2012, however, Ms Slaughter took a meat cleaver to Ms Sandberg&rsquo;s insinuation that anyone with brains and determination can navigate the work-family obstacle course. In a cover story for the Atlantic titled &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/\"><em>Why Women Still Can&rsquo;t Have It All</em></a>&rdquo;, Ms Slaughter revealed that the reason she left her high-octane government job was to spend more time with her two teenage sons. Despite enjoying advantages most working mothers could only dream of (two upper-middle-class incomes and a husband with flexible working hours) she decided she could not properly support her children, who were in Princeton, while living five days a week in Washington, DC. No one could accuse Ms Slaughter of lacking the will or the skill to get ahead in a manâs world. The problem, she wrote, lay not with weak-kneed women but with the structure of the American workplace, where 24-hour demands made it impossible to be both a professional leader and a steady presence in family life. The article has been read 2.7m times, prompting what Ms Slaughter calls a &ldquo;tsunami of response&rdquo;. Some critics took her to task for &ldquo;leaning back&rdquo; and setting a poor example for career women. Others assailed her for preaching a &ldquo;plutocratic&rdquo; feminism focusing on the problems of the rich and powerful.",
