So we put his bowl on his side of the table and he eats Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner with us. Heâll wait till youâre seated and eating to start on his meal, itâs really sweet, though we still have no idea why he does it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>WHAT THATS THE CUTEST THING EVER OMG</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>my cat Puffy has a thing when sheâll lead you to her food bowl, either to refill it or to just stand guard while she eats. Â I adopted her only a year and a half-ish ago, so I figure her behaviour comes from some of her previous living situations with numerous other cats and dogs. Â Sheâs also a very affectionate cat who wants a LOT of attention from people. Â </p>\n<p>my other cat, Nibbles, whom Iâve had since a kitten, comes and eats when we eat. Â She used to eat up on the table, but sheâs quite old and doesnât always like making the jumps anymore. Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cats are interesting.Â  My cat will ignore an open bag of cat food, only eating food out of her bowl.Â  If her bowl is empty, sheâll meow until I fill the bowl, but sheâll completely ignore the bag of food.Â  I no longer even bother putting it out of reach, because I know she wonât try to get into it.Â  The bag is wide open, itâd be really easy for her to get into it.Â  She just ignores it for some reason.</p></blockquote>",
