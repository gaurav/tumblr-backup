I begin to hear voices, and canât concentrate. So I am doing what seems to best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I donât think two people could have been happier till this terrible disease came. I canât fight it any longer, I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I canât even write this properly. I canât read. What I want to say is that I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that âeverybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I canât go on spoiling your life any longer.\n</p><p>I donât think two people could have been happier than we have been.\n</p><p>V.\n</p><div align=\"right\">-â Virginia Woolfâs suicide letter to her husband, Leonard, March 1941</div>",
