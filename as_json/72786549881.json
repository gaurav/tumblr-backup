In fact only two main characters are male.</p>\n<p>2) Both male characters take typically non-masculine hobbies. Emerson Cod knits almost non-stop and makes pop-up books. Ned is literally called âThe Pie-Makerâ because he bakes homestyle pies from his motherâs method. Both are shown to be very nurturing and even maternal characters. Conversely, the women? A pair of professional travelling show performers that have gritty sexual scandals the way men usually get (see the entire âChuckâs fatherâ storylines), a beekeeper who is the single most positive and optimistic character imaginable, and a former professional jockey- Three of four pro athletes.</p>\n<p>3) You could very easily make the claim Ned is asexual.</p>\n<p>4) Yes, the storyline is about romance. But itâs also about the positive side of a love story, and their only drama lies in overcoming their inability to actually share contact.</p>\n<p>5) A very good friend of mine recommended this show to me as âDisney for adults.â I told her it was already on my list to watch because âItâs by Bryan Fuller, from Wonderfalls and Dead Like Me.â Bryan Fuller is now most known for âHannibal.â The same camera methods and bright colours and lighting techniques Hannibal is known for? Perfected in this show, just using a different tone- The same colour methods in reverse, upping the vivid greens and yellows instead of reds and blues, which sells emotion both ways.</p>\n<p>7) Probably one of the best examples of a modern day fairy tale possible.</p>\n<p>8) Narrated by Jim Dale- The narrator for the HP audio books.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I donât know if anyoneâs already added links to this, but all of these here work and if you hover over the links, an episode description shows :)</p>\n<p><strong>Season 1:</strong></p>\n<ol><li><a href=\"http://www.free-tv-video-online.me/player/nosvideo.php?id=lyn5wi7u3min\" title='Ned owns and operates a pie bakery and seems to lead a perfectly normal life.
