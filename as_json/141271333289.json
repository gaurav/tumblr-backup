Turns out that if weâd gone even a mile further, we would have happened on a 49-and-counting car pileup, and that 90 was closed for MILES. How we found an unblocked ramp was a matter of great debate, but where this gets weirder still is that at the bottom of the ramp was a closed truck stop and an open church full of teenagersâthey went for youth group, the blizzard started, and they were stuck until the snow stopped. They fed us leftovers from their potluck dinner, prayed with us for safe travel, and when the snow let up they saw us on our way.</p>\n<p>Three days laterâSundayâwe were traveling back and decided to stop at that church to thank them. We found it thanks to the truck stop, but this time it was the truck stop that was open and the church that was closed. Neither of us remembered it looking so decrepit on the trip down, and granted we saw it first at night in a snowstorm, but youâd think weâd have noticed the boarded-up windows. So we asked in at the truck stop.</p>\n<p>The church had been abandoned for ten years. And yet I still had one of their youth group programs under my sun visor, very clearly labeled for the previous week.</p>\n<p>To this day Iâm sure we crossed dimensions somewhere on I-90, and thatâs how we stayed safe. You could tell me itâs because the truck stop was a liminal space and Iâd 100% believe you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I donât mind when this post goes around again because sometimes I get stories like this</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Iâve never told anyone this story besides my sister before, but one of the strangest regrets I have comes from a rest stop. <br/></p>\n<p>It was when I was really little and we were on a road trip heading southwest. The sun had JUST gone down and we had stopped at a rest stop that was pushed up next to a mountain off the side of either I-70 or 285 and my sister and I had popped out to use the restroom. On the way back to the car as I passed the teenager working behind the counter, I heard a voice in my head (Like, <i>heard</i>-heard. The way voices in dream sound when youâre waking up) say: âTell him itâs going to be alright. That the thing heâs worried about will be ok.â</p>\n<p>But I didnât, because just a week earlier my dad had scolded me for being too friendly to strangers.</p>\n<p>I went back to the car, and as we were driving away I felt so bad about it that I wanted to tell my mom to turn around, but my dad was driving, and I was scared. <br/></p>\n<p>Iâve been on both those roads several times since, and Iâve never seen that specific stop again. I donât know if it was renovated, torn down, or whatever, but I still think about that guy and hope things are ok for him.<br/></p>\n</blockquote>",
