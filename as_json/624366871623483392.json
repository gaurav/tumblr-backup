   "quote-text" : "<p>You know, I tell this story about &ndash; we had, y'know, we do these projects where we actually invite community members to go to lynching sites and gather soil, and we give them a jar with the lynching victim&rsquo;s name and the date of the lynching, and we give them a little implement to dig the soil &ndash; I mean, we give them a memo that tells them about the lynching, where the site &ndash; took place, and we did one a few years ago, and this middle-aged Black woman got her memo, she got her jar, she got her implement, and she was sort of scared to go by herself, her sister was supposed to come and she didn&rsquo;t show up, but she found her courage and she got in her car, drove down to this location, West Alabama, very scary place, it was on a dirt road, but she resolved that she was going to dig soil where this lynching took place, and she parked her car, and she walked across this dirt road and found the spot, got down on her knees to begin digging the soil when a truck drove by, and there was this White guy in the truck and he stared at her as he drove by and slowed down, and she watched the truck stop about a hundred meters past her, and then turn around and drive back by her again, and the man looked at her again while she was on her knees there, and then he parked the truck and he got out of the truck, big White guy, and he starts walking towards her, and she told me later that when he started walking toward her, she was afraid. And we tell people when they&rsquo;re doing these collections that they don&rsquo;t have to tell anybody what they&rsquo;re doing, if they want to say they&rsquo;re just getting dirt for their garden, they&rsquo;re allowed to say that &ndash; and that&rsquo;s what she was going to do and this man walked up to her and he said, &ldquo;what are you doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>And she told me that when he asked her that, she said, &ldquo;somethin&rsquo; got a hold of me, Mr. Stevenson, and I looked at that man and I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m digging soil because this is where a Black man was lynched in 1937, I&rsquo;m going to honor his life today&rsquo;&rdquo;, and she said she started digging real first because she didn&rsquo;t know what was going to happen and the man just stood there, and then eventually the man asked, he said, &ldquo;Does that paper talk about the lynching?&rdquo;, and she said, &ldquo;it does&rdquo;, and then he said, &ldquo;can I read it?&rdquo;, and she gave the man the paper and the man started reading while she kept digging and finally the man finished reading, he put the paper down, and she told me he shocked her, 'cos he asked her, he said, &ldquo;would it be okay if I helped you?&rdquo;, and she said, &ldquo;of course!&rdquo;, and the man got down on his knees next to her, and she offered him the implement to dig the soil, and he said, &ldquo;no no no no no, you use that, I&rsquo;ll just use my hands&rdquo;, and then she said the man started throwing his hands into the soil and picking up the soil and putting it in the jar and he kept throwing his hands into the soil, and they kept putting 'em in the jar and she said he did it with such commitment and such conviction that it moved her, and before she knew it she had tears running down her face and the man stopped and said, &ldquo;oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry, I&rsquo;m upsetting you&rdquo;, and she said, &ldquo;no no no, you&rsquo;re blessing me&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>And they kept digging together, him with his hands and her with this implement, and they got to the top of the jar, the soil was almost, the jar was almost full, and she noticed that the man had slowed down and she looked at him and she could see his shoulders shaking, and then she saw tears running down his face and she stopped, and she put her hand on his shoulder and she said, &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;, and she said the man looked at her, and he said, &ldquo;no, no I&rsquo;m not okay&rdquo;. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just so worried that my grandfather might have been one of the people who lynched that man&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>And she said they both sat on that roadside in tears and they finally finished, and he stood up and said, &ldquo;I want to take a picture of you holding the jar&rdquo;, and she said, &ldquo;I want to take a picture of you holding the jar&rdquo;, and they took pictures of one another holding this jar, and she brought that man back to Montgomery to be with her when she put the jar in our exhibit, and &ndash; you know, beautiful things like that don&rsquo;t always happen when you tell the truth, but until we tell the truth, we deny ourselves the opportunity for beauty. You know, justice can be beautiful, reconciliation can be beautiful, repair can be beautiful &ndash; it&rsquo;s powerful to actually experience redemption, and we deny ourselves that when we insist on denying our broken past, our ugly past, our racist past, when we insist on avoiding the truth.</p>",
