human!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Â </i></p><p>in 1916 a French officer in his twenties writes his</p><p>doctoral dissertation under</p><p> heavy mortar fire.</p><p>he sends it by mail, a page </p><p>at a time, to his wife.</p><p>a week before heâs to step up to the podium and</p><p> defend his work rather than hiscountry</p><p>he is killed in action.</p><p>even as the bullets rip </p><p>through him he still wishes he could have become a professor</p><p>in French literature and</p><p>the university awards him a posthumous Ph.D.</p><p><i>sex is</i></p><p><i>Â </i></p><p>a woman breaks down in tears on the phone because</p><p>a week is not enough time to </p><p>get over a breakup.</p><p>her sister drives an hour across town,</p><p>comes up the front steps with</p><p> a gallon of ice cream and somebeer</p><p>and together they eat moose tracks and marathon </p><p>every</p><p>single</p><p><i>Godzilla </i>movie</p><p>ever made.</p><p><i>Â </i></p><p><i>sex is</i></p><p>sheâs late for work but her car isnât </p><p>starting and even through her coat and hat sheâs cold. </p><p>she knows she canât be late again because sheâs missed</p><p>one time too many already because her</p><p>fatherâs nurse was sick with the flu and someone</p><p>needed to help him bathe.</p><p>the clock ticks past fifteen after and she hits </p><p>the wheel like itâs a heavy bag as though that will help</p><p>steps on the gas like the car will go</p><p>and wonders how she will pay rent</p><p>and how she will feed her father.</p><p><i>sex is</i></p><p><i>Â </i></p><p>it takes three people to hold the predator down because </p><p>even with the cover over his head </p><p>a bleeding eye and shattered wing</p><p>he is trying to hurt them.</p><p>none of them have seen this bird before in their lives but</p><p>they bandage his wing and head and give him a painkiller and</p><p>put him in a warm place to sleep and heal because</p><p>it is right.</p><p>at first he is paralyzed and cannot</p><p> fly but soon he is taking steps</p><p>and then fluttering, and then soaring, and</p><p>six months later he is whole and healed and hunting.</p><p>once he is gone they never see him again</p><p>which means theyâve done their jobs right.</p><p><b><i>sex </i></b><i>is<b></b></i></p><p><b><i>Â </i></b></p><p>in 1969 a girl watches grey-and-white footage on her parentsâ tinytelevision and</p><p>canât quite believe that what she is seeing is not a movie set but</p><p>another planet. </p><p>the men on the screen look a little like </p><p>aliens with bulbous heads and no faces and fat</p><p>marshmallow arms</p><p>but they are still men.</p><p>her mother puffs on a cigarette behind her and declares that</p><p>this is progress</p><p>even if it was just a small step.</p><p>the girl grows up to be not an astronaut but a secretary </p><p>and her boss calls her âsweetheartâ. </p><p><i> but sex is </i></p><p><i>Â </i></p><p>a boy is taught that real men donât cry so</p><p>he doesnât. </p><p>when his best friend dies from a self-inflicted</p><p>gunshot wound, he locks himself</p><p>in the shower every day and sobs under scalding </p><p>water until it runs cold </p><p>so nobody will see him grieving</p><p>so nobody will see that tears are just love that </p><p>has no place left to go.</p><p>he learns to dull love rather than suppress its expression and</p><p>soon the owner of the liquor store knows him by name.</p><p>three DUIs, two evictions, and twelve steps later,</p><p>he is feeding people at a homeless shelter,</p><p>and telling them itâs all right to cry.</p><p><i>Sex is</i></p><p><i>Â </i></p><p>the broken man tells the comedian </p><p>that he didnât mean to step in front of the car but the rain</p><p>made it hard to see.</p><p>he seems okay but his leg </p><p>does not. </p><p>the comedian clutches a grubby receipt with the driverâs </p><p>plate number scrawled on the back</p><p>in pink pen, stands out in the rain so the broken man</p><p> can have his umbrella,</p><p>and gives him the comedy routine that ruined his career</p><p>so the man doesnât think about the pain in his leg.</p><p>once heâs out of the hospital, the fixed man sends him a thank-you card</p><p>with kittens on it.</p><p><i>what makes us human</i></p><p><i>Â </i></p><p>yawning is contagious,</p><p>and there is a species of bird whose young we call âpufflingsâ.</p><p>melodic collections of sound, spaced by silence,</p><p>can move us to tears.</p><p>the tallest building in the world is </p><p>two-thousand seven-hundred and seventeen feet tall.</p><p>in less than eighty years we went from our first powered flight</p><p>to touching the moon,</p><p>and in one-hundred from the first phone call </p><p>to instantaneous connection between thinking machines of our own\ncreation.</p><p>we make pies out of tree organs </p><p>and let cowâs milk ferment until it hardens and then </p><p>we put them together, because apple pie with cheddar cheese is\ndelicious.</p><p><i>what makes us human is</i></p><p>the earliest\nfossils of anatomically modern humans are</p><p>two-hundred\nthousand years old .</p><p>we have had\npet dogs </p><p>for sixteen-thousand\nof those years, longer</p><p>than corn </p><p>or the\nwheel.</p><p>the steps we\ntake are part of </p><p>one of the\nmost energy-efficient gaits the</p><p>animal\nkingdom has ever seen.</p><p>we invented\nthe concepts of love</p><p>and hate</p><p>and justice,\nand mercy</p><p>and we\ninvented the language to convey them.</p><p>we sharpened\nrocks, then metal, to convince other people</p><p>who donât\nhold the same idea of those things as we do</p><p>because we\nthink </p><p>itâs right.</p><p>we are two\nhundred millennia of love and disappointment and</p><p>sorrow and\ninnovation and </p><p>mercy and kindness\nand dreams</p><p>and failure</p><p>and\nrecovery.</p><p><i>but sex is what makes us
