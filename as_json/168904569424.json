   "quote-text" : "<p>I was faced with a choice. Should I continue pushing forward in an endeavor that I was no longer sure was the right fit, or should I abandon my Ph.D. to return to India and take some time to figure things out?</p>\n\n<p>My family and friends discouraged me from leaving. They thought I was risking both my career and the livelihood of my family, whom I helped support with my doctoral stipend. Nonetheless, about 2 years in, I concluded that I would never be satisfied with my work if I didn&rsquo;t make a change. Even though leaving my program would bring trade-offs and uncertainty, it was better to find the right fit than to risk a lifetime of career frustration and disappointment.</p>\n\n<p>My family&rsquo;s dreams were shattered. Most of my former colleagues and mentors started ignoring me. My confidence was shaken when I was out of a job for months and my harum-scarum decision left me and my family struggling. Seeing my colleagues and friends racing ahead in their careers while I was still unsure about what I wanted also made me doubt my decision.</p>",
