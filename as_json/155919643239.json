   "regular-body" : "<p><a href=\"http://magpiesyousharply.tumblr.com/post/155917812959/the-last-two-days-were-definitively-not-ones\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">magpiesyousharply</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>the last two days were definitively not ones during which I should have considered it wise to watch Neon Genesis Evangelion for the first time, and yet I have watched most of it, and trusting my instincts and wikipedia, Iâm dropping it at episode 24.Â <br/><br/>there was something really, really good there, but Iâm not sure if I buy that the dissolution of the last few episodes into relative incoherence is legit meta-commentary on the human incapacity to comprehend death. for that to have been done successfully, the show should have ended sooner and killed a lot more of its characters. I wonder what governed the writersâ decisionsâ¦</p></blockquote>\n<p>I actually liked <a href=\"http://wiki.evageeks.org/Episode_25\">episode #25, <em>The World Ending/Do you love me?</em></a> and <a href=\"http://wiki.evageeks.org/Episode_26\">episode #26, <em>The Beast that Shouted Love at the Heart of the World/Take Care of Yourself</em></a> the last time I watched Neon Genesis Evengelion (which, admittedly, was a loooong time ago). Ostensibly it talks you through Instrumentality, but especially after seeing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Evangelion\"><em>The End of Evangelion</em></a>, which literally shows you what Instrumentality looks like (it looks very cool), I see the last two episodes as the show doubling back on itself, going back to all that Hedgehog&rsquo;s Dilemma stuff and asking what the point of other people even is if all humans are doomed to fail those they care about. To me, the last two episodes are important because (minor spoilers, I guess?), they come to an understanding between the strands of the story of the people who are letting down the people they love (&hellip; everybody?) and the people who are trying to make the world a better place (also everybody?) and decide that yes, actually, even if you are fighting an ever-escalating war against supernatural aliens, it&rsquo;s better to do it with friends, EVEN IF YOU WILL INEVITABLY LET THOSE FRIENDS DOWN FROM TIME TO TIME BECAUSE YOU ARE ONLY HUMAN. To twenty-something-me watching NGE for the first time and to me today typing this, that&rsquo;s a really, really important thing to think about. Which, ultimately, is what I love about this show, because I don&rsquo;t know enough stories that ask questions like &ldquo;what is the point of life if you&rsquo;re useless?&rdquo;, which is a question that speaks to me very, very deeply.</p>\n\n<p>I also kinda like how <em>The End of Evangelion</em> dovetails with the last two episodes in an outside/inside sort of way, although I really don&rsquo;t know what that scene (you know which one I mean) are there. There are, as you requested, far more characters being killed off there :).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway here are some random NGE thoughts because it&rsquo;s hard to work on a Sunday at a Panera Bread.</p>",
