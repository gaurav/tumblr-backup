On every side of the pen were huge signs saying âYou can pet me, but donât pick me up!â  <br/>One day two absolutely huge guys came in and one immediately reaches into the pen to grab a rabbit. Before i could say anything his friend grabbed his arm and asked him  âdid you see the sign?â<br/>He said âyeah! it says that you can pick them up but donât pet them!â<br/>Then he went quiet for a moment and softly said âI didnât read it right did I?â<br/>And his friend just puts his arm on his shoulder and said âits ok, i know youâve got that thing where words get mixed up. Let just pet these cute lil shitsâ<br/>And I still havenât gotten over that interaction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was walking my dog through Boston bc he likes the like car rides. Heâs a little thing tbh we call him short and long.<br/>So this huge scary man with a full beard approaches me like âhey can my buddy and I pet your dog? He gets nervous around dogs but yourâs is so small I think itâs a good place to start.â <br/>Ofc I was like âyes heâs very friendly!â So this guy brings his equally big friend over and they sit on the floor while this man looks terrified of my tiny dog so big man number one asks âcan I pick him up?â And i say yes so he picks him up and puts him on man number twoâs lap and man number two is abt to freak out and his friend straight up just goes âhey man, itâs okay just relax Iâd never let anything hurt you. Heâs a good boy.â Iâll never forget it ever bc I know that man looked at me (5'3 , glasses, probably wearing a sweater vest) and my dog (kinda goofy looking little thing) and was like âah yes the two least intimidating living things Iâve seen in Boston all day heâll feel relaxed around themâ and went out of his way to help his friend. It makes me so happy</p></blockquote>",
