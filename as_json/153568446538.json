I had expected my assimilation to be an easy one - English was my first language and every almost material thing I consumed was American. I had a great deal of difficulty adjusting, with people making fun of my last name, and the strange obsession at how âotherâ I was. I was angry, I resisted change, but eventually I adapted.\n\n\n\n\n<br/></p><p>My interpretation of Arielâs story has changed as Iâve grown. I now greatly admire her courage to leave the world she knows behind and to explore a new one, without resistance or anger, but with curiosity and wonder.<br/></p><p>In the original fairy tale, the little mermaid has her tongue cut out, constantly feels as if sheâs walking on sharp knives, and her toes are bleeding. \n\nI also imagined that the splitting of her tail would have resulted in a scar on her inner thigh. It is quite a testament to her strength that she endures this pain while arriving into a world she knows little about. She did this alone.Â </p><p>If I were given that choice, I would not be as brave.Â </p><p>Ariel is the fourth in my <a href=\"http://enveniya.tumblr.com/tagged/disney-women-series\">Disney Women series.</a></p><p>\n\n<a href=\"https://society6.com/artofelaineho\">Buy this as a print on Society6!</a>\n\n<br/></p></blockquote>",
