   "quote-text" : "<p>If Hillary Clinton has made any new friends in this surly election year, that group should start with the souvenir-sellers at Trump rallies. Like itinerant camp-followers trailing a medieval army, they line the approach roads to the Republicanâs campaign events for hundreds of yards. Mere Clinton rallies make do with a few salesman offering campaign buttons and shirts. In contrast Trump events are surrounded by a proper street bazaar, featuring lines of trestle tables groaning beneath heaped t-shirts, baseball caps, bumper stickers, Trump-themed shot glasses, bobble-head dolls and (a new sighting this week) a Trump-Pence 2016 doormat. And the salesmen certainly owe Mrs Clinton. For even as the Republicanâs grim poll numbers threaten to leave his campaign deflating like a punctured beachball, it is loathing of the Democratic first lady thatâmore than any other forceâpuffs it back up again. The vendors are cashing in on that hatred during these final days, and Trump supporters cannot get enough of their wares.</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;]Â Using the street market as a guide, it can be reported that for Trump fans the most popular closing message of this election, by far, is to boast of being one of the millions of voters whose apparent tolerance for sexism and prejudice against Muslims, Mexicans and other outsiders Mrs Clinton recently called âdeplorableâ.</p>",
