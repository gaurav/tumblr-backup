We find out that Hagrid actually <i>went </i>to Hogwarts as a student really in the 2nd bookâwhen we see <i>Tom Riddle</i>, the <b><i>Slytherin</i></b> prefect confront Hagrid in his own dorm room, and the two seemed pretty familiar with each other. <br/></p>\n<p>Hagrid was expelled as a 3rd year. He was born in 1928, and Riddle was born 1926. So Riddle was a 5th year prefect, <br/></p>\n<p>Hagrid doesnât seem like he was particularly good at any branch of magic other than Care of Magical Creatures, so how would the two know each other? Hagrid is 2 years younger than Tom, so how would they have known each other well enough for Hagrid to call him âTom,â not Riddle?<br/></p>\n<p>Now, the prefects are some of the <i>only people </i>the oblivious Harry Potter recognizes from other Houses, other than Quidditch players. And yet weâve <b><i>never</i></b> heard about prefects from other Houses coming in to discipline Gryffindor students. Hell weâve never heard about people from other houses in the Gryffindor common room <i>period</i>. You really think that Tom Riddle would know enough about a 3rd year Gryffindor nobody, someone who isnât even his <i>year</i>?</p>\n<p>Not to mention<b><i> </i></b><i>this is when the Chamber of Secrets is open, a girl was <b>killed</b>.</i> You think Gryffindor is going to let a powerful Slytherin traipse around their tower, when tensions are running high after being terrified all year? <i><b>No.</b></i><br/></p>\n<p>But you know whatâs much more plausible? <i><b>Hagrid was a Slytherin</b></i>.</p>\n<p>Whereas it wouldnât make any sense to be friends with a young Gryiffindor, young <i>Slytherins </i>are Tomâs responsibility. Tom knowing, and being able to access a 3rd year <b><i>Slytherinâs</i></b> dormitoryâhow he knew Hagrid well enough to know about Arigog, and where heâs keptâ makes <i>much more sense</i>. Not to mention they are looking for the heir of <b><i>Slytherin</i></b>. Guess what hint hint theyâre probably looking at a <i><b>Slytherin</b></i> to be accountable for Myrtleâs murder. Not a Gryffindor.</p>\n<p>The only reason suspicion fell on Harry was because he could literally talk to snakes, and people who didnât know enough about what happened in the past made the obvious leap âSlytherinâs monster=Snake; harry can talk to snakes=Harryâs the heir of Slytherin.â <br/></p>\n<p>And damn, <i>it makes sense </i>that Hagridâs a Slytherin. If thereâs anyone whoâs a true friend to Harry itâs <i>Hagrid, </i>the man who tried to make sure Harry had everything he ever needed (I still get emotional thinking about Hagrid making that scrapbook for Harry. @Dumbledore maybe Harry wouldnât have been so enraptured by the Mirror of Erised if he actually had a damn <i>photo</i> of his parents).</p>\n<p>And it makes perfect sense for Hagrid to be prejudiced against Slytherin. These are the people who threw him <i>away</i>, who got him kicked out of Hogwarts, who would have taken away his home if Dumbledore hadnât allowed him to stay on as groundskeeper. And yeah donât get me wrong Hagrid definitely has morals but heâs like the definition of Slytherin loyalty, heâd do <i>anything </i>for the people he cares about. Just think of him hiding Gawp in the Forbidden Forrest. Itâs not safe or wise or brave, he keeps that knowledge from even Dumbledore (Dumbledore, who he believes in not because of his ideals or what he stands for but because he is <i>Dumbledore</i>, someone Hagrid is loyal to). <br/></p>\n<p>But this is his <i>brother,</i> who is going to get hurt if he stays with the other giants. Think of <i>how</i> Hagrid loves Harryânow, think of Narcissa Malfoy, willing to do <i>anything </i>if it meant the chance her son was alive, even defy Voldemort and go against what her family had been working towards for <i>decades</i>. Hagrid is <i>such </i>a Slytherin parent. <br/></p>\n<p><b>tl;dr</b> sure, JKR might have posted on her twitter or Pottermore that Hagrid was a Gryffindor, but writing is about <i>showing</i>, not telling. And she might have told us that heâs Gryffindor, but sheâs showed us heâs Slytherin<br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Plus when you look at basically everything he does, both as a teacher and in his personal life, Ambition seems to be the guiding trait. Gotta teach kids about care of magical creatures? Go big or go home; I have already ordered a crate of super illegal giant death bugs. Dragon? Dragon motherfucker. Gorgeous half-giantess headmistresss of the most elite and snootiest academy in europe? Mack on <i>immediately</i>.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âSomeoneâs gotta take care of them, and that someoneâs gonna be <i>me.â</i><br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Great analysis!</p>\n</blockquote>",
