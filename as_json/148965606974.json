   "regular-body" : "<p>as someone that has gone through this system on this.</p>\n\n<p>\nMany moons ago I went out to meet this gal I met online, I knew she was under 18 but I was early 20s and stupid so I went out to meet her and I got busted as I walked in the door, tossed in jail and got a lawyer and got out on probation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n5 years, 2 lie detector tests, 2 years of mandatory therapy, tens of thousands of dollars spent out of mine and my families pocket, 1 career, 1 fiancee all lost along the way because I never really did anything but I thought with my love whistle insetad of the head on my shoulders.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo now I&rsquo;m labeled a pure hardcore sex offender. I&rsquo;m on the website here in my state, my glorious picture is up there, they put posters all around my white color suburbanite neighborhood, my neighbors who knew me couldn&rsquo;t believe it, the ones who didn&rsquo;t&rsquo; saw me and pulled their kids aside like I was going to eat them alive when it was the farthest thing from the truth. I&rsquo;ve had people spit upon my father who has a lawn business, mom who gets harrassed at her school from other teachers cause of it, my friends got hassled and dropped me like the plague. I got to see who my true friends and people were. People who were still there, still loyal, looked past my stupid mistake and realized &ldquo;Hey, he did something really dumb, but he didn&rsquo;t rape some kid or kidnap a school bus full of girl scouts.&rdquo;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo here I sit here after I got all my ducks in a row, got a consulting job because companies hire business&rsquo; not people so no background check, going to school out of state because they don&rsquo;t require registration or signup stating that some kiddy raper is attending their school, I live in a place that&rsquo;s in a decent area but the county is trying to squeeze people like me out because the community thinks we are all &lsquo;horrible representations of society&rsquo; or some nonsense. I had to grow up alot along the way and I learned alot about the legal and criminal system and know there are thousands upon thousands of guys like me that are out there that really won&rsquo;t be able to be 'themselves&rsquo; for 20yrs or so until it&rsquo;s all cleared up in the system and maybe a pardon for the governator.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI&rsquo;m sorry for what I did to my family, to my friends, and to that lil child whom when I saw her in court I would&rsquo;ve never done a thing to as she looked like my lil 12 yr old sister.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDo I feel my debt to society has been repaid? You be the judge on that. I&rsquo;ll let you know in 10 more years.</p>\n\n<div align=\"right\">&ndash; Anonymous Coward, <a href=\"http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=217044&amp;cid=17623284\">on Slashdot</a></div>",
