Itâs described as âso beautifulâ and captivates anyone who looks at it<br/>2. It shines with an inner light<br/>3. When Jules and Vincent are trying to get it, all the shots aimed at them miss, implying theyâre miraculously immune to bullets, implying that theyâre on some kind of divine quest.<br/>4. Marsellus Wallace really, <i>really</i> wants to get it</p>\n<p>But there are some flaws in the argument. Why would Brett - this random nerdy-looking Californian guyÂ - have Marsellusâ soul? And how do you keep a soul in a briefcase?</p>\n<p>A stronger theory would have to involve something else beautiful and glowing with inner light, which also impels people to seek it and even kill for it, which also provides supernatural protection to those who rightfully seek it, but which could fit in a briefcase and which a nerdy Californian might be uniquely skilled at knowing where to find.</p>\n<p>My point is, I think Marsellus Wallace has at least one Silmaril.<br/><br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On further reflection this absolutely checks out.</p>\n<p>The apparent incongruity is: Marsellus would have to be one of the Noldor for his Silmaril obsession to make sense. But the Noldor all died or returned to Valinor, so why would one be in 1990s Los Angeles?</p>\n<p>But according to Wikipedia:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Maglor, along with Galadriel and Gil-galad, was the greatest surviving Noldo at the beginning of the Second Age. There is speculation that he remained even after the Third Age in Middle-earth, forbidden forever from returning to Valinor.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So Maglor is the one Noldo who could presumably still be on a Silmaril hunt in 1990s LA. And his name in Quenya is <i>Macalaur</i><i>Ã«</i><b><i>, </i></b>meaning âgold-cleaverâ. </p>\n<p>âMaglorâ in Sindarin. âMacalaurÃ«â in Quenya. So âMarsellusâ in English. It all fits!<br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, the more I look into this, the more itâs just obviously true.</p>\n<p>Throughout the movie, Jules is obsessed with a Bible verse, Ezekiel 25:17. The verse goes:</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brotherâs keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.</i></p></blockquote>\n<p>This doesnât match any real verse in the Book of Ezekiel, but it exactly matches the life of Maglor in the Silmarillion.</p>\n<p>During the First Age, Maglor ruled âMaglorâs Gapâ, a valley which connected the lands of the Elves and the lands of Morgoth. Maglor held Maglorâs Gap for 450 years until Morgoth finally conquered the valley; Maglor led the retreat of his people, thus âshepherding the weak through the valley of darknessâ. </p>\n<p>He fled to the fortress of his brother, Maedhros, in Himling, where he helped defendÂ Maedhrosâ lands and peopleÂ in battle -Â making himÂ &quot;his brotherâs keeper&quot;. </p>\n<p>In the ensuing battles, he captured the young Elrond and Elros, who had been orphaned after their parents fled across the sea, and adopted them - making him âthe finder of lost childrenâ. </p>\n<p>As for âstriking down with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothersâ, thatâs about as Noldor as it gets.</p>\n<p>So this must be Julesâ way of praising his lord, which he disguises as a Bible verse so nobody questions why itâs so significant to him.<br/></p>\n</blockquote>",
