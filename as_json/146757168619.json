These live births account for the roughly 600 Hogwarts students during Harryâs first year, and would make the birth rate of Wizards approximately 0.01% of the population.</p>\n<p>TheÂ population of the United States in 2014 was 318.9 million -Â \n\n23.1% of which were children 0-17. That would mean there were 73,665,900 children in 2014. Checking live births from a time period of 1997-2003 (which would account for children aged 11-17) gives us 27,978,287 children. If 0.01% of them were magical, weâre left with 27,978 school age magical children in the United States in 2014.</p>\n<p>If we wanted school sizes similar to Hogwarts - 600 children to a school - we would need <i>at minimum</i>Â 47 magical schools. If we wanted it more comparable to our own schooling - with an average student body size of roughly 1,430 students combined between middle school and high school during the 2009-2010 school years - weâre down to a minimum of 20 magical schools.</p>\n<p>So, long story short. <b>It is statistically impossible for there to be a single magical school in the United States.</b></p>\n<p>Itâs far more likely there is at least one school in each state, possibly more than one in much larger states like Alaska, Texas, and California while a single school could feasibly serve the clustered smaller states like Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I know that JK Rowling wanted to put the American school near the so-called magic hot-spot of the United States, Salem Massachusetts, where the witch trials occurred and all thatâ¦Â </p>\n<p>But that is pretty narrow-minded thinking when it comes to considering the potential for many diverse wizarding schools in the US.</p>\n<p>For example, New Orleans is the home of so much magic lore in relation to Voodoo and the cultures behind it.Â On top of diversifying the background of some of these magic schools, having a school in the South would make sense, I think.Â </p>\n<p>A major event in the history of the United States was the Civil War, and I imagine that it not only divided human families but also magic families, as well. Itâd make sense for there to at least be a school that those in the North went to, and a school that those in the South went to.</p>\n<p>On top of that, a big part of American history was the expansion into the West. That was a lot of land to cover, and I highly doubt witches or wizards would want to make the commute across thousands of miles to go to school. If thatâs the case, I imagine theyâd build a new school out West too, maybe in California.</p>\n<p>Also, Hawaii Iâm sure would have its own schoolâ¦since it is on an island in the Pacific, <i>thousands of miles</i> from the US mainland.Â </p>\n<p>And letâs not forget that the United States is a country made up of immigrants: people from different and diverse backgrounds, each with origin cultures steeped in traditions and magic lore.Â </p>\n<p>Surely magic immigrants created a school in New York? Or Chinese immigrants founded a magic school out West? Was there a secret magic school along the Underground Railroad that escaped slaves ran to, not only to practice their magic, but to seek refuge?Â </p>\n<p>I mean, <i>come on</i>, Rowling. Iâve only listed a few examples out of hundreds of countries whose people make up the population of the US.Â </p>\n<p>Oh, and since Illvermorny is using Native American mythical creatures as mascots , Iâd <i>sincerely </i>hope that there is at least one magic school in the United States founded by at least one of the unique 500+ tribes that were in this country in the first place.</p>\n<p>Cause being completely honest, I think weâre all a little tired of seeing one culture taking select aspects from other cultures without fully appreciating the cultures behind those aspects.Â </p>\n</blockquote>",
