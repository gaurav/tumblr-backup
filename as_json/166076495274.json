Â I mean, thereâs just no arguing it. Â They packbond readily, and quickly, and unbelievably strongly. Â Once a human has packbonded with a thing, they will do anything to help and protect that thing. Â </p>\n<p>Thereâs a downside to that, not often mentioned. Â It uses up a <i>lot </i>of their time and energy to build those packbonds, maintain those packbonds, and most especially to do the work of helping and protecting those with whom they have packbonded. Â It doesnât leave them a lot of time and energy for helping other beings.Â <br/><br/>If you want a human to help you â if you want to reliably get their best effort â you have to packbond with them first.<br/><br/>â<i><b>Yeah? So?</b>â</i><br/>So youâre probably going to be working with humans for most, if not all, of your career. Â No matter how good or bad you are at your job, there will come a time when you need someone else in your workspace to help you with something, whether thatâs manning the fry station for 2 minutes while you pee, sending over those numbers from marketing, or dropping everything to teach you how to do a thing that your boss told you to do or else youâd be fired. Â <br/><br/>Not to mention the big things. Â They donât give promotions to just their friends â at least not so much any more. Promotions go to the people whoâve completed big, visible, important projects. Â It seems fair until you consider,,,, <i>who</i>Â gets the big, important, visible projects assigned to them in the first place? Â <br/><br/>Humans give boosts to the people theyâve packbonded with. Â They mention packbondeeâs accomplishments to the boss (or the bossâ boss). Â They cover for the mistakes of people theyâve packbonded with. Â </p>\n<p>â<i>Thatâs not right! It shouldnât be a popularity contest! It should be about who does the best ââÂ </i><br/>Listen to me.Â <br/><b>Listen.</b></p>\n<p>You may be right. Â You may be the most correct creature to have ever spoken since the beginning of galactic civilization.Â <br/><br/>It<br/>does<br/>not<br/>matter<br/><br/>Humans packbond. Itâs what they do. I canât stop it. You canât stop it. Â No power in theÂ âverse can stop it. This is how the human do.<br/><br/>All you can do is work with it.Â <br/><br/><b>\n\nIf you want a human to help you â if you want to reliably get their best effort â you have to packbond with them first.\n\n</b><br/><br/>â<i>Look, Iâm introverted and scared of people and I have social anxiety so I really donât know how to ââ<br/></i>Hey, my pal, I feel you. Â I, too, am introverted. And I have social anxiety. And I have PTSD that actually â and I recognize that this is bizarre â has âbusiness networkingâ as a trigger. Â <br/><br/>For you, I have good news:<br/><i>Humans will packbond with anything.</i> Â <br/><br/>Like, you donât really actually have to do anything. You kinda just have toâ¦ exist. In their presence. They kinda do the rest. Â <br/><br/>If you can talk with them, that speeds things up. Â But it doesnât have to be, like, <i>good</i>Â conversation. Like, it can totally go<br/><br/>You: boy, sure is hot out!<br/>Human: Man oh man, can you believe it?<br/>You: Wow, yeah<br/>Human: Totally<br/>You: â¦.<br/>Human: â¦.</p>\n<p>This conversation â as awkward and uncomfortable as it felt to you, has caused this human to packbond with you a little more. If you repeat it weekly, you will get good results.Â </p>\n<p><b>THE TAKEAWAYS</b><br/></p>\n<ul><li>You need to packbond with the humans you come in contact with</li>\n<li>Taking time to do that is not only justifiable, it is an important part of your job, and should be treated as such</li>\n<li>That is to say that, as much as you hate it (and believe me, I understand), you <i>have to take time away from actual work</i>Â and <i>dedicate it to packbonding</i>Â with your fellow workers</li>\n</ul><p><b>Tips</b></p>\n<ul><li>Plan out your packbonding time. Itâs easier if you can initiate than if a human springs packbonding-time on you all unexpected. Â In an office job I like to use Friday afternoon, but adjust according to what makes sense to you and your situation.</li>\n<li>Keep some packbonding-time questions handy. Â My go-to list is:</li>\n<ul><li>(If itâs Monday or Tuesday) How was your weekend?</li>\n<li>(If itâs Wednesday) Howâs your week been so far?<br/></li>\n<li>(If itâs Thursday or Friday) Any big plans for the weekend?</li>\n<li>Howâs your day been?</li>\n</ul><li>You donât have to care about the answers to these questions. All you have to do is remember that if the human is answering questions, <i>they are not asking you any questions</i>. Â Therefore questions are your friend. Â If you ask follow-up questions, you may be able to get through the entire packbonding time without having to do any of the talking</li>\n<li>Learn to disengage from packbonding. Â You can use basically the same sentence (or variants on it), but youâll want to practice it so that you can make it sound natural. Â I useÂ âAwesome! Well, I gotta get going. Have a good one!â</li>\n</ul><p>I know it feels overwhelming, but a few minutes of packbonding, once a week, is all you need. Â Once you build it into your habits it can be no more annoying than doing dishes or showering. Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>additional crucial packhack: humans will like you more IF you ask them to do you a small favor AND THEN express gratitude and indebtedness. it seems counter intuitive to ASK for favors instead of DOING favors but thatâs the key! they will keep tabs on your welfare if they think you owe them; they will want to keep you around if you establish yourself as someone who appreciates their efforts. humans thrive on mutual caretaking. invite them to caretake you and then show you are eager to caretake back and you will have a solid workplace alliance started. \n\n</p>\n<p> small favor examples: can you pass me that tool item? may i try some of your snack? could you remind me of a fact? can you give me some advice?\n</p>\n<p>most humans feel safe when they feel valued. it is this crucial emotional drive that underlies many human interactions. it is especially important in the workplace, where those that are not valued are ruthlessly cut out and discarded from the pack. so assure your humans that you appreciate them and they will come to you for the comfort of it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
