   "regular-body" : "<p>Podcasts! I&rsquo;ve loved them since 2007, long before they were cool. For a long, long time I&rsquo;ve assumed that I can take on just about anything life throws at me, because I have an almost complete catalogue of every episode of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_News_Quiz\"><em>The News Quiz</em></a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermode_and_Mayo's_Film_Review\"><em>Kermode and Mayo&rsquo;s Film Review</em></a> from 2007 until the present day. Since a friend of mine asked, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m listening to right now:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lvdrj/episodes/downloads\"><em>Kermode and Mayo&rsquo;s Film Review</em></a>: Mark Kermode is a tremendously entertaining film critic with a fondness for horror movies and a hatred of Michael Bay, who started off as a guest contributor on Simon Mayo&rsquo;s radio show. Now spun off as its own show, this is two hours of bickering, movie reviews, celebrity interviews (most of which are pretty good) and general silliness that will make you want to feast your eyes on whichever film Mark likes that week.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/series/fiction-podcast\"><em>The New Yorker Fiction Podcast</em></a>: The idea is brilliant &ndash; get a famous writer who has published a short story in <em>The New Yorker</em>, and ask them to read (and then discuss) their favourite short story previously published in <em>The New Yorker</em>. Can be a bit hit and miss, but when it hits, it <em>really</em> hits, with some <em>amazing</em> stories.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nrv5m/episodes/downloads\"><em>Drama of the Week</em></a>: I <em>love</em> radio drama, as a strange and wonderful medium where you can literally crawl into your audiences&rsquo; ear and treat them to &ldquo;sights&rdquo; (and, more importantly, sounds) that evoke landscapes and situations impossible in any other medium. <em>Very</em> hit and miss &ndash; too many of the plays they produce aren&rsquo;t properly designed for audio &ndash; but when it&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;s very, <em>very</em> good, telling deeply emotional stories with grace and style.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/\"><em>The History of Rome</em></a>: In July 2007, Mike Duncan decided to create a podcast about the history of the Romans, from city state to kingdom to republic to empire. On May 6, 2012 &ndash; almost five years, 179 episodes and 1,229 historical years later &ndash; he reached the life and death of Romulus Augustulus, generally considered the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire. A masterful and entertaining telling of an empire that still affects everything we do today (says I, writing this post in the Roman month of Junius).</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.revolutionspodcast.com/\"><em>Revolutions</em></a>: Mike Duncan then moved on to cover important revolutions. These vary a bit from revolution to revolution &ndash; the American Revolution can get a bit slow, the British revolution can be terribly confusing &ndash; but the French Revolution is, well, as tremendous as the original, and I loved the latest series on the Haitian Revolution.<br/></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/downloads\"><em>In Our Time</em></a>: Want to listen to history, but move quicker than a historical year in a week? <em>In Our Time</em> brings together three academics every week to go over a historical event or person, a fictional story or book, a myth or an idea, and goes over its origin, development and result. Wide-ranging and &ndash; if you get the right people &ndash; terribly entertaining.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/features/audio/series/detail/74636\"><em>Poetry Off The Shelf</em></a>: I&rsquo;m not hugely into poetry, but this podcast from the Poetry Foundation asks interesting questions, talks to young and old poets, and includes recordings of poetry being read out.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.in/\"><em>The Mahabharata Podcast</em></a>: one hundred episodes covering the story of the longest historical epic in the world, right from the original frame story until the death of the Pandavas. Pretty neat stuff, and told in a casual and fun way.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/podcast/\"><em>The Nature Podcast</em></a>: Published by one of the premier scientific journals on the planet, this podcast plays like a weekly science show, quickly introducing you to the scientists responsible for a new breakthrough, coming soon to a lab near you. Written to be widely accessible and interesting for non-scientists, and every month, includes a recording of their favourite science fiction story published that month in Nature.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02pc9pj/episodes/downloads\"><em>Friday Night Comedy</em></a>: A third of the year, this plays <em>The Now Show</em>, a topical news show I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of. A third of the year, they play other comedy shows, such as <em>Dead Ringers</em>, which are alright, I guess. But the last third is dedicated to <em>The News Quiz</em>, a grande dame of the British radio establishment. Once upon a time, <em>The News Quiz</em> was my favourite show in production, and &ndash; although it&rsquo;s still excellent &ndash; it&rsquo;s just not the same since long-time host Sandi Toksvig left in 2015. Still, it&rsquo;s four comedians joking about the week&rsquo;s news, and Miles Jupp is a very, very funny man. Listen out for particularly for Jeremy Hardy, Francis Wheen, Andy Hamilton, Mark Steel, Susan Calman, Sue Perkins and Rebecca Front, but almost all the comedians on the show are excellent.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/audio-edition\"><em>The Economist Audio Edition</em></a>: Not actually a podcast, but for a pretty reasonable price, you can get every article in <em>The Economist</em> read out for you to listen to on the move.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/fivethirtyeight-elections/id1077418457?mt=2\"><em>FiveThirtyEight Elections Podcast</em></a>: FiveThirtyEight is a website that aggregates polls to predict the outcome in US elections; this podcast covers their findings and provides incisive, snarky comments on this years&rsquo; elections.</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://thewestwingweekly.com/\"><em>The West Wing Weekly</em></a>: Finally, a very new podcast, only on its tenth episode: this podcast hosted by Hrishikesh Hirway and Joshua Malina plan to go over every episode of <em>The West Wing</em>. Fans of the TV show can use it to relive memories; newbies should probably watch each episode (available on Netflix in the US and some other countries) before listening in to that week&rsquo;s podcast. Most excitingly, this show brings cast and crew from the show &ndash; so far, the actors playing Charlie Young, Donna Moss and Toby Ziegler, as well as a writer, costume designer and political advisor &ndash; to talk about their view on the show. Just in time for the US election season!</li>\n\n</ul>",
