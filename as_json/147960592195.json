   "quote-text" : "<p>Jaffe mistook Sellers for Woody Allen, and Sellers, a talented impressionist, decided to go along with it for shits and giggles and pretended to be Allen. Unfortunately, the joke went south when Jaffe went on a rant to him about what an asshole this Peter Sellers guy was. Yes, some people&rsquo;s real lives are bad sitcom plots.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, Sellers had disappeared. When the panicking studio was finally able to contact him, they found out that he was in Sweden. That&rsquo;s right, Sellers wasn&rsquo;t just insulted, he was &ldquo;skip the country and move to Sweden&rdquo; insulted, which, for anyone who knew him, was kind of just your average every day Peter Sellers tantrum. But, Casino Royale was already way over budget and couldn&rsquo;t just cancel production, even if their leading man had taken his ball and gone to Scandinavia. The necessity of finishing the movie at all costs required massive rewrites, leading to the movie&rsquo;s notoriously insane conceit of having multiple actors play James Bond.</p>\n\n<p>Sellers eventually calmed down after breathing into a paper bag and punching a few pillows and then flew back to America to film a few final scenes to finish the project. We like to think that the moment he walked onto the set, at least one person shouted, &ldquo;HOLY SHIT, IT&rsquo;S WOODY ALLEN!&rdquo;</p>",
