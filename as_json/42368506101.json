   "quote-text" : "<p>Youâre single because youâre single. Itâs not because you texted too much or too little or waited 33 minutes to respond because he took 23. Itâs not because you met up with your ex that night at 5 a.m. that no one knows about, or because you kissed another boy after a date with a loser.</p>\n\n<p>Youâre not single because you spit food on that date or tripped coming out the the movie theatre. Youâre not single because you hurt your first boyfriend really badly when you were 15 or because you have yet, to this day, to apologize. Itâs not because you were secretly jealous when your friend got a boyfriend or that a guy you dated for two months now has a really cute girlfriend and looks really happy. And youâre happy for him. But still ill that he found someone before you.</p>\n\n<p>Youâre not single because you slept with your ex boyfriend. Youâre not single because half the world found out when you didnât even want to remember it yourself. Youâre not single because you think the guy your friend wants to hook you up with is ugly or not tall enough. Itâs not because youâre not willing to put up with someone who doesnât brush their teeth on a regular basis.</p>\n\n<p>Youâre not single because your standards are too high. Good for you for having standards. Itâs not because you didnât like that really, really good guy who wanted to take you on a date and you just werenât feeling it. And itâs not because you like to wear pajama pants as soon as you get home and wash all the makeup off your face. Youâre not single because you didnât learn enough from the past or would rather chill on a Friday night with your blanket and a cold beer than shower, get ready, and go out. Youâre not single because something is wrong with you.</p>\n\n<p>You are single because you are single. Itâs really as simple as that. You havenât made the connection with another heart yet. You can get dolled up, dress cute, cut your hair, dye your hair, tweeze your eyebrows, put on lipstick and you may still. be. single. You can go out to a bar hoping to meet the love of your life and not find a damn one in the place attractive. And itâs going to remain that way until itâs time for you to find one. Stop hoping for it. Start living the life that you do have instead of wishing for things that you donât have. There will come a time youâll meet a boy and youâll have to give up some of this single freedom you currently have. Start being more thankful. Start doing that now.</p>",
