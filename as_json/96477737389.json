   "quote-text" : "<p>You donât even know why. Maybe you just didnât want to watch your friend die. Maybe you wanted to believe the nightmares were just another thing you left behind in your old life. Maybe sometimes you just need to fucking <em>cry</em>. Sure, you knew it was a dream, but that didnât make it feel any better. You really want a drink but at the same time you know that would just make everything worse. So you cry instead, until it feels better. </p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n\n<p>But just look how you ended up. Times like this, when you think about what could have been, it really does feel like your whole life is just the epilogue to a sad story. Like you already failed, and this is just the long aftermath. Like no matter how hard you try to rise up there will always be something anchoring you to your past.</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n\n<p>Youâre a <em>wizard</em>. You have <em>friends</em>. You went to a formal dinner with a <em>scary countess</em>! And today, you are going to meet up with an Imperial Legionnaire and travel to <em>Kvatch</em>. Things are looking up for you. When you think about all that you accomplished yesterday alone, things start to look brighter. You start to feel like maybe this <em>is</em> the prequel to something great.</p>",
