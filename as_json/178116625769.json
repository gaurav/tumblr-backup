In the V&amp;A cafÃ©, thereâs a piano that customers can just use without asking, and a man sat down at it and started to play. I know nothing about music, but it sounded great to me.</p>\n<p>At the table next to me was an old couple, probably in their late 60s, and the man kept tutting and sighing as the chap played, and I heard him mutter to his wife, âthis is a [insert musty dead white composer here], there should be more MELODY,â and he just kept griping. </p>\n<p>Now, to me, an ignorant and uncultured millennial, it just seemed super cool that we were essentially getting a free piano accompaniment to our Earl Grey, and so I stayed a while to listen, because this guy had some balls getting up there to play in front of us all, and I wanted him to feel appreciated. I also live tweeted it, and the old man kept glaring at me for being on the phone. I kid you not.</p>\n<p>When he was done, we all (including the grumpy old man) applauded for him, and he looked really surprised. I thought Iâd let him know how much I loved it, because I have terrible social anxiety and am trying to get out of my shell a bit, so I approached him and said âI know nothing about music, but I really enjoyed hearing you play,â and he BEAMED. </p>\n<p>Turns out that heâs a concert pianist over from Toronto and we essentially got treated to a free preview of his concert tomorrow night. We chatted for a bit and then I left, and the old couple still looked really grouchy.</p>\n<p>But hey. Ungrateful millennials!!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Trust me. Millennials have been so deprived, you can give them a free napkin and they will cry. Old people have been so spoiled that you can literally give them a free symphony and they will bitch about it. Nothing satisfies old people. </p>\n</blockquote>",
