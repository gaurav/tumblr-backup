   "answer" : "<p>11) The best dream Iâve ever had is one I canât remember. All I know is that I was happy, felt like I belonged somewhere, and could âfeelâ that I had âfamilyâ. Second best, though, was the one that involved skydiving from the ISS.</p>\n<p>12) Iâm not going to talk about the worst (it happened mid-deployment and involved people at home is all Iâm gonna say), but the second worst involved finding out that my childhood dog had been secretly resurrected/cloned and found to have an incurable condition that meant he was going to have to be put down. Pretty much the dream was me cradling him while he was in a medically induced coma and crying while they figured out what to do about it. Scarily enough, that happened only a year or two back too.</p>\n<p>My subconscious is actively hostile towards me.</p>\n<p>32) Different place then! Some of my earliest memories were from living in the Mojave Desert, and there really wasnât much to do but go play in a âfieldâ of scrub brush until it got dark, at which point in time I usually would have to run like hell home because thatâs when the rattlesnakes and scorpions came out.</p>\n<p>This was also the place where I remember my dad pouring gasoline down a scorpion hole and then lighting it, only to have a flaming and now very angry scorpion emerge from it.</p>\n<p>36) Guilty pleasures, huh? Going to see movies in theaters is one, because of time deployed (got used to not going) and because they require a non-trivial amount of time that I could be doing other things. Watching TV shows or movies in general, actually, tends to be a guilty pleasure because of that, but actually going to a movie theater? oh man. such popcorn. much soda. wow.</p>\n<p>Actually, in general anything that involves me just having fun or a good time is probably a guilty pleasure at this point.</p>\n<p>ninja edit: actually, Apple devices fit into the category of guilty pleasures as well. I donât need them, but there is something in the aesthetic that gives me a tremendous amount of joy to use or even hold, and they are kind of a whole âI survived Iraq so I deserve some nice electronics if Iâm going to be spending all my time on themâ thing. I donâtÂ <em>need</em> a MacBook and an iPhone and an iPad, but after surviving Iraq itâs like the one thing that I actually make a point to justify spending money on. I use them enough on a day to day basis that itâs not a poorly spent cost (they are probably one of the best uses of money based on usage, actually), but at a point I have definitely (repeatedly) made the decision to get a new phone instead of, say, traveling for a vacation.</p>\n<p>I suspect that one of the things I will get when I have achieved some modicum of economic stability is a Mac Pro, just because it is kind of the ultimate guilty pleasure in that regard.</p>",
