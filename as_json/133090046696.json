I called your office but you werenât there! So I tried to call YOUR office to figure out where HE was but YOU werenât there!â</p>\n<p>Two grad students standing outside a closed and locked door yelling, âCome out of the damn office. You havenât left for days. If you didnât have a couch in there Iâd be concerned as to where you were sleeping!â</p>\n<p>A religious studies professor apologizing for being late to class because, âsecurity stopped me because Iâm dressed like a hobbitâ</p>\n<p>Watched a professor snort the results of my experiment to determine if I had the right final compound.</p>\n<p>Two archeology professors toss priceless fossilized teeth back and forth in an attempt to figure out who is smarter by âguessing the type of tooth and species of animal before it landsâ</p>\n<p>Multiple fully degreed individuals throw dry ice at one another in an attempt to be first to use the lab/get that piece of equipment/or change the iPod song.</p>\n<p>A genetics professor build furniture out of stacks of paper and planks of wood because she is that far behind in grading papers/responding. One of the impromptu furniture pieces housed a fish tank.</p>\n<p>I could go on but I think that covers the larger portion of the insanityâ¦</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every time it comes around on my dash, it gets better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-Â I have had a professor buy a huge fuckoff bottle of rum during fieldwork in Costa Rica and let the undergrads get wasted because âyouâre not underage in Costa Rica and weâll be up all night with the bats anyway!â</p>\n<p>- Same professor hung a bat from her headlamp and wore it as a decoration for an entire night.Â </p>\n<p>- A whole swarm of older women - and these are women with PhDs and world-renown bat experts,Â <i>theÂ </i>bigwigs - all, to aÂ <i>woman,Â </i>go to the formal charity dinner at an international research symposium in Toronto inÂ <i>late OctoberÂ </i>dressed in skimpy Batgirl costumes. Because Halloween was that weekend, you see.</p>\n<p>- At a different conference, a professor get blackout drunk and pass out on the side of the road.Â </p>\n<p>- âYeah, we have to say we did it properly for the grant but to be really honest, Miracle-gro works better.â</p>\n<p>- Teaching lab: we had liquid nitrogen for a demo, and after class the professor, the other TA, and I spent a good two hours freezing and breaking things in it.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>a chemistry class begins with 30 students nine months later just six of us left sitting on tables dipping paper into contaminated chemicals to see what happens when we burn it teacher making idle suggestions while he marks our work</p>\n<p>âgo to the fume hood thing, yeah now put some potassium in chlorineâ can i burn the results sir? âfuck it sure whatever its tainted anywayâ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The prof Iâm working for just asked me if I knew how to pick a lock, and when I responded âyesâ she replied, âsee, this is why I hire the former delinquents instead of the suck-ups. Youâre actually useful.â</p>\n<p>I then let her into her office.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âSecurity stopped me because Iâm dressed like a hobbit.â I would bet <i>anything</i> this has happened to Dr. Medievalist.</p>\n<p>Semi-related non-academic anecdote: The concert hall security guys tried to throw out our violone player in between performances this spring because they thought he was a homeless guy. Despite the fact that he was wearing concert blackâ¦ and carrying a violone. There is no more obvious instrument. <br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of my English Professors admitted that sometimes âyou just have to do a soliloquyâ and would phone up the main office of the department on the internal phoneline to recite a Shakespearean monologue at them. No greeting, no warning, just âTo be or not to beâ.<br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>every time i read this stuff i think about how upset vulcans would be to meet earthâs greatest scientific minds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The entire staff of a world-renowned astrophysics research centre gathering in the back parking lot to watch two postdocs amateurishly annihilate an old macbook with thermite. (The microwave astronomers were the smart ones, we hid behind a berm.)</p>\n<p>An ancient Latvian radio astronomer whoâs odd hours andâ¦ Â <i>affable </i>demeanor guaranteed that hisÂ lab never received visitors, just whispered admonitions to never <i>ever</i> park shit in front of his door, even if it was addressed to him.</p>\n<p>Waiting for three weeks for the instituteâs IT guy to fix one of the data servers, only to watch him  (literally)Â come running when a grad student decided to solve the problem herself. (She got the access code to the server room from the janitorâ¦)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>-The guys in the algae lab brewing beer under the hoodsâ¦<br/></p><p>-One of the genetics grad students selling some of the accidentally eyeless zebrafishes for 50$ a piece (or best offer) on ebay<br/><br/>-The email that went to the entire ebio department: âWeâre expecting a shipment of bees; it should arrive in the next few days. Â If you find the box in the hall during that time, please do not shake the box. If the bees get loose like last time, PLEASE DO NOT KILL THEM, THEY ARE HARMLESS, just capture them and bring them to us.â</p></blockquote>",
