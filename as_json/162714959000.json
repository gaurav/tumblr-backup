   "answer" : "<p>Alrighty, Iâve told this story before, but itâs been about a year.</p><p>Now, understand that I am a camping and scouting veteran, a camp counselor, and an avid hiker; I know damn well what poison ivy looks like, along with every possible rhyme to remind a person.</p><p>Leaves of three let it be, red tint, itâs not difficult. I could spot the stuff from a mile away.</p><p>But this was a special occasion.</p><p>I was a brand new wildlife student, two years ago, facing for some reason my toughest challenge yetâDendrology lab. We learned about 10-20 new trees every week in the field, and every week we were also tested on what we learned last class (along with their scientific names).</p><p>Memorizing Latin wasnât an issue, but I was having notable trouble keeping up with identification (and we werenât even into autumn yet, when the leaves are gone).</p><p>Now, when youâve been doing something for years and years, itâs easy to sometimes overlook something odd, because you tend to fall into a habit of glancing and moving on, confident in your assessment, as long as the stakes arenât enormous. So this is a field quiz, no big deal. My professor is relaxed. Heâs an impressive dude with a lot of knowledge, and he could probably about identify a tree blindfolded using some sort of echolocation known only to foresters.</p><p>So when he glanced at a small but particularly interesting poison ivy plant, he didnât notice something crucial, which was its uncharacteristic leaf.</p><p>See, we were just a few classes into the semester, so we only knew about two trees with a very specific type of leaf called aÂ âmitten lobe,â and those were Sassafras and Box elder.</p><p>Sassafras can actually produce three different leaves, the middle one in the photo being the mitten lobe (<a href=\"http://www.augustaga.gov/1630/Sassafras\">x</a>):</p><figure data-orig-width=\"563\" data-orig-height=\"347\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a818ba7dea48c9998bcdd2c805c6e150/tumblr_inline_oqslo1I2601qfpscz_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"563\" data-orig-height=\"347\"/></figure><p>So this poison ivy plant was not only growing out of the ground like a sapling, instead of as a vine or small shrub like we were used to, but it also had a mitten lobe as one of its few leaves.</p><p>Iâm not sure if it was a mutated plant, or what exactly was going on, but this is not a normal thing.</p><p>Our professor missed it, but we were all hyper-analyzing this tree, because we were new to identification. So of course we all saw the mitten lobe and thought, well itâs either sassafras or box elder!</p><p>So, there are a few ways to tell sassafras and box elder apart. One methodâin retrospect, the recommended methodâbeing the branch alignment, and the <i>other</i>Â being the distinctive smell and taste of sassafras (if you crush a leaf, it smells a lot like fruit loops).</p><p>And how are a bunch of new, gung-ho students halfway through a test and eyeball-deep in stress going to decide on the difference?</p><p>Weâre going to <i>stick the leaf in our mouths.</i></p><p>So we all grabbed a leaf and tore it apart to share with our classmates and stuck the pieces in our mouths. Understand when I say not a <i>single</i>Â student knew the mistake we were making, because they absolutely would have interrupted the test.</p><p>Our professor was distracted, and we were all chewing slowly, as if at a wine tasting, mulling over the taste of the leaf and our options. It didnât taste like sassafras, or like <i>anything</i>, really.</p><p>Which I said. Which is when our professor turned to me in horror and saidÂ âMolly Anne, did you just eat that leaf?â</p><p>I told him yes, and he was SO Plainly Horrified that Iâm not kidding when I say half of the classâthe half that hadnât partaken in our cursed saladâimmediately realized what we had done and put their pencils to their test to write inÂ âpoison ivy.â</p><p>Anyway, once it dawned on us our terrible mistake, a few things happened:</p><p>My professor asked us how we managed this, and we basically kept repeatingÂ âTHE MITTEN LOBEâ over and over again.</p><p>I called my mom, and she immediately saidÂ âyouâre not doing well in Dendrology, are you?â</p><p>She went to Poison control for advice, and I had to break the news to my classmates that we were likely to break out orally <i>and</i>Â anally.</p><p>After the quiz, I went home for the day, and my professor called me twice to make sure I was alright.</p><p>I had never gotten poison ivy before, so I held out hope my apparent immunity would hold up for me in my darkest hour.</p><p>Although I wasnât the only leaf-eater, I was the loudest and most dramatic in the aftermath (I found it hilarious), so I became <i>known</i>Â as the Only Fallen Dendrology Student in the incident.</p><p>When it came up in a lecture later that week, one of my professors laughed,Â âthat was <i>you</i>?â</p><p>I am pleased to report that I did not break out. However, a few of my classmates werenât so lucky and said they got it badly in their throat.</p><p>A week later, once of my classes toured an herb farm, and I asked to taste every single plant we saw, even when toldÂ âsureâ¦.you canâ¦but itâs disgusting.â</p><p>Someone in my class couldnât believe my dedication and said,Â âdidnât you just eat poison ivy like a day ago?â</p><figure data-orig-width=\"745\" data-orig-height=\"277\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b48d4c44a2d4ef134b795161b47d0abd/tumblr_inline_oqsmtlRaGi1qfpscz_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"745\" data-orig-height=\"277\"/></figure><p>Yes, I did.</p>",
