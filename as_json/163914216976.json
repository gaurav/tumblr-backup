Live in the beautiful world you deserve where you can fit shit in your pocket.<br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Curvy ladies: Menâs dress pants have more room in the butt. I donât know why, I only know that all my dress pants for work are off the rack in the menâs department in Target. Literally <i>nobody</i> has noticed, except a couple of my younger coworkers whoâve asked meâyou guessed itââoh my god, where did you find pants with <i>pockets?â</i></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Tall ladies: menâs pants are easier to find in longer lengths than womenâs pants are.<br/></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Trans ladies: Wanna get on this gravy train, but afraid people will misgender you for wearing clothes off the menâs racks? Step one: tell me who these people are and I will punch them in the face. Step two: if it doesnât make you dysphoric, please donât feel obligated to wear pants off the womenâs racks if pants off the menâs racks are more comfy/useful to you. Iâm a cis woman whoâs been wearing pants from the boysâ section and, later, the menâs section, ever since I hit puberty and in thirteen years maybe, <i>maybe</i> half a dozen people have noticed. And itâs always women asking the oh-my-god-pockets question. Youâre all good. &lt;3</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Fat ladies: you will pay the same for a pair of 42x32 jeans as for a pair of 34x32 jeans, instead of having to pay some kind of Fat Penance Tax by way of being in the âplus sizeâ section. Also, did I mention <i>more room in the butt?</i></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>Ladies concerned about modesty: For obvious reasons, there is more crotch space in menâs pants. Embrace it and enjoy a life free from cameltoe worries and spontaneous labia-wedgies when you squat down.<br/></p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>All ladies: I swear to god the waists in womenâs pants these days are made specifically to fit exactly nobody so that no matter what you do, your underwear will show. <i>Menâs pants do not do this. </i>The waists sit where theyâre supposed to and will actually lay flat against the small of your back instead of flopping open to show your unmentionables to the world. If you want hiphugger jeans, buy one leg-length too small and one waist-size too large and let them hang, and they still wonât accidentally show your undies. Menâs pants will last longer. They cost less, in a lot of cases. Embrace the menâs jeans. Buy the menâs jeans. Stop buying shitty flimsy womenâs jeans that wear out in six months.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<p>AND FINALLY: to determine your size in menâs pants, take a tape measure around your waist at its smallest point. This is your waist size and will be the first number in a pair of menâs pants. Next, take the tape measure from about an inch below your no-no squares parts, and run it to your ankle. (You may need a friend or parent to help with this.) This is your inseam length, and will be the second number on a pair of menâs pants. Menâs and boysâ pants are tailored the same way, so if you have trouble finding your waist size in menâs, hop over to the boysâ section. Feel no shame. If theyâd give us decent fucking pants we wouldnât have to steal theirs, right?<br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Listen you guys, I am SO MAD ABOUT THIS. Iâve seen this first post before, and recently my mom said,Â âHey, did you see that post on Tumblr about shopping for jeans in the menâs department?â</p>\n<p>And I said yeah, Iâd seen it, Iâve been through the Trying To Fit Clothes On My Stupid Body wars, and this post really only applied to skinny jeans because theyâre so stretchy. It couldnât possibly work for regular jeans! I have TRIED SO MANY TIMES. Iâve always shopped in the menâs department because womenâs clothes are like 90% bullshit and 10% fake pockets.</p>\n<p>But I hadnât seen the second addition, which gave me more hope, and I decided to just try on a few pairs when I was at Old Navy the other day. They have some âclassicâ jeans with no give to them at all, which is what I was trying on years ago that convinced me it just wasnât possible. (Jeans in my price range didnât really come with any form of stretch back then, as I recall. Textile technology is bad-ass.) But these days they mostly haveÂ âflexâ jeans that have some give to them. (Womenâs jeans are usually labeledÂ âstretchâ but apparently menâs have to beÂ âflexâ like they need stretchy garments so their HUGE MUSCLES donât just TEAR THEIR CLOTHES!)</p>\n<p>This was totally an impulse decision so I couldnât measure myself, but I grabbed a few sizes based on what I vaguely thought my measurements probably were and decided it couldnât possibly be worse than the endless cycle of regret, dissatisfaction, and recrimination that is trying on womenâs clothing.</p>\n<p>The first pair I tried on fit like a DREAM. Iâve been gaining weight lately which is a whole separate nightmare (mainly centered around âbut I donât WANT to buy new bras, this is bullshit!â) and the reason I need to buy new jeans because nothing freaking fits me, and I was sure these wouldnât either, but DAMN. Theyâre the best pair of jeans I own. Twice as thick, pockets twice as big, legs nice and loose (they donât even sell womenâs jeans with a cut remotely similar to this), and contrary to my super dumb opinion from before this experience, theyâve got my plenty of room for all my womanly curvey bits. AND because theyâre actually a relaxed fit instead of trying to cling to every inch of me, they donât show my weight nearly as much as my womenâs jeans do, theyâre easier to move in, theyâre not constantly inching down my hips with every move I make, and overall they just make me feel GOOD about how I look which is a strange new sensation I could definitely get used to.</p>\n<p>Itâs like a miracle. I want to cry both out of joy and because of all the shitty jeans now filling my closet when I could have been buying comfortable, relaxed, pocket-having menâs jeans all these years. Many blessings to the posters above, may your crops grow and your cows give milk and your jeans hold all the gadgets you desire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also: menâs pants have constant sizes that are based off of actual measurements instead of the womenâs whatever-the-company-wants-to-make-the-size sizes. Theyâre far more reliable and your size will translate to other brands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwkCp77SahwQB21S2v-Nh-g\">@get-dunkd-on</a> help me remember this for our next Goodwill run lmao</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I HAVE to try some menâs jeans. Sick of these super skinny show everything always having to be hitched up no pocket crap jeans!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Honestly signal boost. Because imagine this actually starts some kind of ludicrous pants revolution that ends up causing womenâs pants fashion companyâs sales to tank, absolutely forcing them to realize menâs pants have always had the right idea and start doing that instead of this bullshit. Like just imagine. And donât just signal boost this. Tell every woman you know. Tell every trans friend and every curvy friend out there. You see a lady down the street, stop her and tell her youâve discovered a new gospel and itâs purchasing menâs pants. With the way women spread information when weâre excited, the mentioned scenario could actually be hella achievable</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>PRAISE THE UNIVERSE I FOUND THIS POST AGAIN</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Guys. Gals. Non binary pals. As a trans ftm person who just recently started shopping in the menâs department and has gigantic hips full of dysphoria let me tell you a thing.</p>\n<p>Athletic cut jeans have more room in the butt. I repeat. Athletic cut jeans have more room in the butt. You donât need to go to the dress pants to fit your lovely curvy self in there. Go to the regular section or big and tall if youâre a bit taller and/or wider, and thereâll be a little section of athletic style jeans. Theyâve still got the giant blessed pockets and the room in the crotch and if youâre really curvy with a large bone structure like I am you can get yourself some quality pants.</p>\n<p>This has been an addition by your local nb trans dude. Thank you for your time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Reblog to save a fucking life</p>\n</blockquote>",
