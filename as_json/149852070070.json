Thrush is <i>extremely</i>\n uncomfortable, and expensive to treat repeatedly; over-the-counter preparations rarely completely eradicate it. Menorrhagia, which I \nhave, makes you anÃ¦mic. PCOS causes hormonal symptoms that are socially \ndifficult (facial hair, acne, hair loss, weight gain). Fibroids are <i>so common</i>, and are often treated with a hysterectomy. </p>\n<p>Add in fibromylgia, which affects 8x as many women as men, as well as lupus (and almost any other autoimmune condition), systemic exertion intolerance disorder (SEID), iron deficiency anÃ¦mia  (<a href=\"http://womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/autoimmune-diseases.html#d\">all of which affect more women than men</a>), and you have well over 25% of childbearing-age women globally living with chronic pain and tiredness.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2015/02/13/chronic-pain-overwhelmingly-experienced-women-trouble-getting-care/\">Chronic pain is overwhelmingly experienced by women, and women are less likely to be taken seriously or given treatment by medical professionals</a>. I went through two years of diagnostics to finally find out I had occipital neuralgia; I felt doubted when I described my pain at every step of the way, but was lucky to have a partner who was persistent in helping me get treatment.</p>\n<p>Basically, <i>this is a huge problem</i>, and also one of the reasons I have been considering medical school.<br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Donât forget that <b>most pharmaceuticals go to market without ever having been tested on people with a uterus</b>, lest someone get pregnantâ¦ seriously that is the whole rationale behind not testing &gt;50% of the population. This has been legislated against in some countries, but still persists in the of majority drug development because of other regulations, and traditions and laziness. The use of a drug is of course monitored in the population after release, <b>but the people âtryingâ it in this capacity get none of the insurance, close and regular medical examination orÂ monetaryÂ benefit of essentially being in a late stageÂ drug trial.</b> Drugs that are pulled from market after release are sometimes done so on the basis that the dosage is just too high for females/afab people and this is, of course, after theyâve experienced the adverse affects.Â </p>\n<p>This is why <b>if you get pregnant your doctor will take you off basically any and all medication youâre taking (including mental health medication, canât imagine any implications/dire consequences there), not because they know it will have an adverse affect on the foetus but because they have no idea. </b>How wonderfully kind of them to prioritise the health and life of an unborn foetus over that of a living person, letâs just hope they donât become ill whilst pregnant. How charmingly logical it is that they wouldnât even bother to test drugs in people with a uterus because itâs all too difficult and gosh, darn what an ethical conundrum weâve been faced with, letâs just not! Which is so in the spirit of capital S, Science!

Everybody knows that cramps are a normal part of menstruation, and that virtually all people who menstruate experience them throughout their lives, right?</p>\n<p>Except thatâs not right at all.</p>\n<p>Yes, itâs true that about two-thirds of individuals who menstruate begin to experience menstrual pain during adolescence, but itâs basically a side effect of puberty, and normally subsides by your late teens. Only about 20-40% of menstruating adults experience menstrual pain on a regular basis - and according to some estimates, as much as 80% of that figure is due to undiagnosed endometriosis or some other underlying medical condition.</p>\n<p>Yeah, roll those numbers around in your head: if youâre an adult who experiences menstrual cramps, itâs <b>overwhelmingly</b> likely that your pain is a symptom of some potentially serious medical condition.</p>\n<p>And yet we tell folks itâs just a normal thing that everybody has to deal with.<br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bonus round: Look up PCOS and gender identity.</p>\n<p>Then look up PCOS and diabetes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok, to show how incredibly important this post fucking is, I just looked up endometriosis and I match just about every sympton, and it would explain not just my incredibly painful periods but many other things as well. I had no idea this existed. <br/><br/>Please, read this post and reblog this so others can learn. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I will reblog this every time because my cousin (a cis girl) went through seven years of pain without being taken seriously until SHE suggested it was endometriosis. And thatâs not even unusual - thatâs the average amount of time it takes between first symptoms and a diagnosis of endometriosis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><b>True story:</b> I got my appendix taken out when I went in to see the doc for something entirely unrelated. I wasnât even in pain at the time (I thought). I just felt ânormalâ the day I went in.<br/></p>\n<p>Long story short, they took one look at my guts and ended up not only opening me up to take my appendix out, but they had to do additional surgery <i>to scrape dead tissue off my intestines </i>because the ENTIRE inside of my abdomen was covered in necrotic tissue and scarring.</p>\n<p>According to the doc, \n \n\nI âmust have had appendicitis at least onceâ and I just rode it out thinking it was food poisoning or something. Since then, my appendix had been slowly leaking poison into my abdomen every minute of every day up until that day.</p>\n<p>I have no idea when I got appendicitis. This could have been happening for <i>years</i>. Whenever it was, I didnât think it wasÂ âbad enoughâ to warrant seeing a doc, and they might not have caught it at all if not for me going in, again, for something entirely unrelated.<br/></p>\n<p>This is normal. <br/></p>\n<p>Pain is ânormalâ for so many people in this group, and thatâs bullshit. <br/></p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"627\" data-orig-height=\"342\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img data-orig-width=\"627\" data-orig-height=\"342\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9719d636cfd48b98a606a0b0ff5ff7ee/tumblr_inline_o9yrolWwNp1qlmdmz_540.gif\"/></figure></blockquote>",
