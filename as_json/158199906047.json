Â </p>\n<p>because I will not stop talking about robots, and inviting robots over for dinnerÂ and sitting with them in the cafeteria and whispering secrets in their ears.</p>\n<p>because I am already in love with you and no one likes to run a footrace with a cheater.</p>\n<p>because I am too old, and I just keep getting younger, while everyone else gets older, and so we are like two trains on parallel tracks traveling in opposite directions. To love me is liking trying to leap between coaches without being able to see for sure if the other window is open.Â Â </p>\n<p>because I have so many toys in my room, and do not realize that they are toys.Â Â </p>\n<p>Because I write list poems and I do not ever intend to fix this about myself.Â </p>\n<p>Because I am probably smarter than you</p>\n<p>because I am probably a better kisser than you.</p>\n<p>because I am so, so much prettier than you.Â Â </p>\n<p>because you do not have to love me back to get me to stay.</p>\n<p>because I am fat, and to love a fat human is to love a giantâs castle, it takes forever to walk from the dining room to the library, if you forget where you set down your keys they may be gone forever.Â </p>\n<p>because I am fat, and to love a fat person means the apartment is always too small, there is no privacy, you will always share the exact same room with the better version of me you could be loving,Â </p>\n<p>because my actual eyelids are made of actual fog and the lens flares are tacky and contrived</p>\n<p>because I am this kind of a writer, and loving me means knowing that the story of how you loved me will be better than how you ever loved me.Â Â </p>\n<p>because loving me is to always be at the very tallest peak of the roller coaster, inching forward and inching forward and waiting for gravity to take hold and it never does</p>\n<p>because to love me is to love a haunted house; the neighborhood kids tell stories and dare each other to knock on the door, but the door is already open, and inside it is just this, just an ordinary room with most of the furniture removed and all the paint faded and not even one ghost, just a porcelin vase on the kitchen counter, an ironing board in the upstairs closet, Â things the previous owner had no room to carry, things they may even have wanted but did not pack for fear that it would break.
