   "quote-text" : "How to explain this bundle of energy and contradictions? One answer was his father. Frederick William I was a monster: a pigheaded bigot who forced his son to spend his childhood on the parade ground and regarded his interest in books and music as a sign of effeminacy. He bullied him so badly that the boy tried to flee the country with his best friend. Frederick the elder punished him by having his friend beheaded in front of his eyes. He later forced him to marry Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick WolfenbÃ¼ttel-Bevern, who, according to young Frederickâs sister Charlotte, smelt so rank that âshe must have a dozen or so anal fistulasâ. Everything Frederick did was designed both to defy his father and to get the better of him. Even as he flaunted his love of learning, he expanded Prussiaâs power far beyond anything the old man could have imagined. This anti-father fixation put the great into Frederick. But it also turned him into a brute who bullied his siblings just as he had been bullied himself and turned his most talented brother, Henry, into an implacable enemy.",
