   "quote-text" : "There&rsquo;s a young woman sitting near him who looks like she&rsquo;s probably good in bed, but she&rsquo;s not his wife and he has no desire to commit adultery, or so he tells himself, as he sits on the edge of her bed with his pants around his ankles. Is he taking them off or putting them on? He&rsquo;s not sure, but now he pulls them on and limps home, having left his beribboned crutches somewhere. On arrival, he finds all the Kewpie dolls, which were put on a shelf when the babies started coming, now scattered about the apartment, beheaded and with their limbs amputated. One of the babies is crying, so, while he warms up a bottle of milk on the stove, he goes into its room to give it a pacifier and discovers a note from his wife pinned to its pajamas, which says that she has gone off to the hospital to have another baby and she&rsquo;d better not find him here when she gets back, because if she does she&rsquo;ll kill him. He believes her, so he&rsquo;s soon out on the streets again, wondering if he ever gave that bottle to the baby, or if it&rsquo;s still boiling away on the stove.",
