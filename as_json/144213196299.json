   "quote-text" : "<p>Graduate students work for themselves and not a coach, but the sports analogy is useful nevertheless. It was with Popovich&rsquo;s teaching in mind that I&rsquo;ve lately instituted a rotating lunch schedule with my dissertation students. I now try to eat lunch with one of them each week when school is in session. We don&rsquo;t go anyplace fancy (because it&rsquo;s not about the food), and I always pay (because it&rsquo;s not about the money, either).</p>\n\n<p>The agenda depends on the student. Work, of course, figures in the conversation. With one student, we might talk about a chapter in progress. With another, the subject might be a larger discussion of potential career paths. But we also talk about lots of topics that have nothing to do with school: travel, books, children, politics (though here I&rsquo;m especially careful), or sports.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve learned, though, that what we talk about is not the most important thing. What matters is that we spend time together as people rather than as academics. We already spend a lot of time relating professionally, in what amounts to an exchange economy (in which they provide scholarship and I give them credit). The lunches broaden our shared foundation.</p>\n\n<p>Because the adviser-student relationship inextricably combines the professional and the personal, I&rsquo;m finally suggesting that a graduate student will be a better scholar or scientist if her adviser sits down with her now and then and simply says, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you?&rdquo; If we do that, then there&rsquo;s much less chance that our criticism will come flying around a corner like a grenade. It will have less chance to woundâbecause it won&rsquo;t feel impersonalâand much more chance to correct and motivate instead.</p>",
