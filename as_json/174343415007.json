   "quote-text" : "<p>Weâve talked about all kinds of scary things, like Iâve told you never to get into a car with anyone you donât know and donât ever believe that an adult needs your help finding a puppy or a kitten. Also: no one will ever give you a free iPad or Legos from their car, thatâs just not how the world works.</p>\n\n<p>But for some reason, amidst all the talk of stranger danger and pedophiles, cancer and dying, and me sheepishly asking your friendsâ parents if they have a gun in the house, we havenât really talked about one of the scariest things of all. Those lockdown drills youâre always having at school? No oneâs being straight with you about those. Theyâre to prepare you in case someone decides to come into your school and murder you, your friends, your principal, the secretaries, and teachers before killing himself (itâs pretty much always a him). Sorry about that.</p>\n\n<p>I love you.</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n\n<p>You could also tell your class that sometimes when I hear a lot of ambulances and fire trucks go by, sirens filling the air with panic, I pay close attention to whether theyâre heading in the direction of your school. And if they are, I check Twitter and our town hashtag and the fire department account to see if anyoneâs mentioned your school. When I get the all clear I think, âSomeone elseâs tragedy today, suckers!â</p>",
