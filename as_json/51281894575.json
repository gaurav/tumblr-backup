That moment of seeing George Takei not being overly-stereotyped when I was a kid was a powerful one. I think the only place I had really seen other Asians on the screen was finding the rare (because I was a kid in mountains, far from the rest of the community) movie that had Asians in it. Unfortunately, a lot of those were the âwhite guy learns martial arts, beats up Asians because âMerikaâ type movies. Which, of course was not TV. They were still the âAsian otherâ just as in MASH backdrops. Anyway, what Iâm trying to say is that Sulu always has a special place in my heart. Star Trek helped me get through some bad emotional spaces as a kid, and I think part of what made it welcoming was having POC, especially George Takei ( since Iâm JA too, and the other Asian American actors who came later), represented on screen in positive and whole characters, with names instead of âSolider #1, Henchman #4, Ninja #18â.</p>\n<p>(via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://reallifedocumentarian.tumblr.com/\">reallifedocumentarian</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>(Proper) representation matters.Â </strong></p>\n<p>(via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://angryasiangirlsunited.tumblr.com/\">angryasiangirlsunited</a>)</p>\n<p>It makes me incandescently angry that the makers of the current trek movies donât grasp that the incredible imagination and sense of potential that gave the original series its beauty and power had literally nothing whatsoever to do with alien starship battles.Â </p>\n<p>Mae Jemison became the first black woman in space, and do you know why she joined NASA?<em> Lt Uhura.</em> Can you imagine, can you even BEGIN TO FATHOM how many scientists, doctors, teachers, artists, mechanics, diplomats, there might be out there in the world who wereÂ like John Cho,Â likeÂ Whoopi Goldberg, who turned on their tv one day and the tv said to them YOU CAN DO THIS, YOU MATTER.Â </p>\n<p>Star Trekâs heart and power is that it painted a reality where people were going to go out into the universe with a sense of curiosity and unity, and where everyone was fundamentally equal. And it didnât just tell you that, it <em>showed</em> you.Â </p>\n<p>(via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://sharpestrose.tumblr.com/\">sharpestrose</a>)</p>",
   "quote-text" : "When I was a kid, you know I immigrated to the States in 1978, and Iâm six years old and watching TV and I didnât see any Asians on television. And you turn on Star Trek and thereâs this Asian guy not chopping anybody up. Heâs honorable, a helmsman of a spaceship, and it was a big, big deal for me to see that and have a role model.",
