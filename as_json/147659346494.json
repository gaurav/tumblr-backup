   "quote-text" : "<p>Populism, isolationism and nativism are distinct from racism. But they can often be found on the same shelf. Towards the end of the 19th century, as Chinese labourers were brought to California to work on the railways, Denis Kearney, a labour-movement leader, made a career out of attacking the &ldquo;Chinaman&rdquo;, laying the groundwork for the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first of several laws to interrupt migration from Asia. Kearney did not just object to Chinese workers undercutting American wages. He found their food, habits and living arrangements revolting. âWhipped curs, abject in docility, mean, contemptible and obedient in all things &hellip; they seem to have no sex. Boys work, girls work; it is all alike to them.â</p>\n\n<p>Mr Trump&rsquo;s assertions that Mexico is not just destroying American workers&rsquo; livelihoods (because of NAFTA), but sending drug-dealers and rapists across the border too, is Kearney for the 21st century. When accused of racism, Mr Trump responds that he loves Hispanics and insists they love him back. His supporters hear what they want to hear.</p>",
