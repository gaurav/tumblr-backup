   "quote-text" : "<p>If it&rsquo;s weird to you that people on the internet would take a story about a miscarriage (even a mawkish fictional one) and turn it into a joke, you likely haven&rsquo;t spent much time online. Buckley knew that readers would have a strong reaction to the piece, and alongside &ldquo;Loss&rdquo; he published a preemptive blog post. In it, he explained that he had planned out this narrative development years in advance. He also cited personal experience: an unplanned pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage that broke him out of a &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; relationship that he had been in in college. He drew on that experience for the comic.</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n\n<p> \tIt&rsquo;s possible that most &ldquo;Loss&rdquo; edits are all in good fun, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that there is something very odd &ndash; probably even wrong &ndash; about finding amusement in intimate tragedy. But the gap between intention and effect is an eternal wellspring for humor online, and Buckley&rsquo;s attempts to reach the heights of pathos with the limited tool set at his disposal revealed a very wide gulf. It wasn&rsquo;t just that a joke about a miscarriage was an easy way for 4chan&rsquo;s gleeful meme artists to shock people &ndash; it was that the strip was so stilted and unaffecting that no one seemed to be able to take it seriously enough to be shocked.</p>\n\n<p>Memes are frameworks; they&rsquo;re skeletons. They often contain jokes, but they are not, in and of themselves, funny. They provide a template onto which an infinite number of punch lines and observations can be written. Their uniformity makes them appealing, because they inherently give preference to those who are in the know; those who can identify the meme when others cannot. You have to know about the aforementioned history of &ldquo;Loss&rdquo; in order to get the joke. If you donât, the remixes make little or no sense. In short, &ldquo;Loss&rdquo; only has the potential to be funny if you know that it is a callback to expectant parents losing their unborn child.</p>",
