   "quote-text" : "<p>Then the case took an unexpected turn. Amy let it be known, through a public defender named Larry Tipton, who was representing her in Massachusetts, that she wanted to be tried for Sethâs death. She had always insisted that the shooting was an accident, and she appeared to resent the implication of the withdrawn indictment. ââShe wants to use a trial to help demonstrate that sheâs innocent,â Tipton said.</p>\n\n<p>âI want the truth to come out,â Amy told me. âI want that for me, for my parents, for closure.â</p>\n\n<p>When violence suddenly ruptures the course of our lives, we tend to tell ourselves stories in order to make it more explicable. Confronted with scrambled pieces of evidence, we arrange them into a narrative. Faced with the same tragic facts, those who concluded that Amy Bishop murdered her brother and those who concluded that she didnât both took messy events and turned them into a story. But neither story was especially convincing.</p>",
