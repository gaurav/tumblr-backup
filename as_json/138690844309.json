If youâve posted your resume on a free job board of any kind, please be aware that people will likely try to scam you. This happened to me literally yesterday, and I very nearly fell for it because Iâm already in contact with some potential employers, and thought this very strange email was associated with one of them:<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"797\" data-orig-height=\"303\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/cf5e9354dde0de823e411215f8d5320e/tumblr_inline_o21kzxAuv01qzwkgn_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"797\" data-orig-height=\"303\"/></figure><p>It seemed odd that the email came from a gmail account, didnât specify what the company or opening was, and that they wanted to brief me about a position someone was already in touch with me about (I assumed)â¦ it was especially strange that they were using weirdly strong language (âwe requireâ) and using messed up spellings, and most of all that they wanted to set up a gchat, but whatever, I just figured it was bureaucratic incompetence.Â </p><p>So then Iâm in touch over gchat with this woman who sends me a long boilerplate about how great Cygna is as an employer. Wait, what? I had no recollection of ever applying to a job at any insurance company. So I ask her if sheâs affiliated with the other company Iâve been in touch with. She doesnât really answer, instead asking me if Iâm ready for the online pre-interview screening, so I ask her where she found my resume. Iâm super polite about it, since I have no idea if this is actually a legit thing or not. She gives me an acronym associated with a job board that I remember looking atâ¦ but donât really remember posting to? I try to log in to the job board. No dice. They donât recognize my email address.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, sheâs giving me all kinds of glorious details about the job: the pay is very generous for data entry, isnât that great?! Work from home! Flexible hours! Golly! Did I think Iâd be interested in that?<br/><br/>The cogs were turning. For one thing, the job sounded horrible, like something that would bore me just to death, and anyway, with my mental health in its current state, I donât want to work from home. I hadnât quite put it together, but it seemed like a bad idea, so I simply told her that it didnât seem like a good fit, and thanked her for her time.<br/><br/>After a few minutes of thinking, setting aside theÂ âholy shit did I just turn down an offer on a lucrative positionâ anxiety of d00m, I realized that it was just a complete scam. Then I blocked her.</p><p>So Iâve done some research, and apparently this is quite commonâ¦</p><p><b>SUMMARY:</b><br/><b>Scammers will find your email on legitimate job boards</b> where youâve posted a resume. Then, if you ask them about it, theyâll <i>claim</i> to have found your resume on a board that you could plausibly have posted to, but probably donât remember, since youâre job-hunting and how would you remember every single thing youâve applied to and posted on? This probably protects them from detection by the operators of the legit board you really did post to in the first place.<br/><br/><b>Scammers also POST FAKE JOBS on legit job boards.</b> These jobs are usually affiliated with a company that has a website strangely devoid of promotional materials.<br/><br/><b>Warning signs if you get an email out of the blue:</b></p><p>\n\nâ¢ They have a generic email address (e.g. gmail, yahoo)<br/>\n\nâ¢ They donât say up front what company they represent or what job it was, and wonât give you a requisition number or anything like that<br/>\n\n â¢ The hours and pay seem weirdly generous<br/>\n\nâ¢ Theyâre super upbeat about what a great candidate you are<br/>â¢ They want to move really fast! <br/><br/>If you let them get to that point, theyâll want your social security number, routing number, and all that jazz, ostensibly so that they can hire you properly. Butâ¦ they wonât. Donât fall for that shit. Youâll end up with a drained bank account and/or a stolen identity. <br/><br/>Stay safe, kids. If Iâd been having more of an anxiety-day than a nihilism-day, I might have let them take me for a ride, just out of fear of passing up a potential chance to pay rent. These shitbuoys prey on people who they can reliably assume are desperate for work: they offer a seemingly amazing opportunity so they can make you even more broke and miserable than you already are.Â <br/><br/><b>RESOURCES</b><br/>\n\nâ¢ \n\nIf youâve been scammed and they actually took your money, you can file a claim with the <a href=\"https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/GettingStarted?NextQID=216&amp;Selected=t#crnt\">Federal Trade Commission</a><br/><a href=\"http://www.job-hunt.org/onlinejobsearchguide/job-search-scams.shtml\">\n\nâ¢ \n\nLots of info</a> on the varieties of job scams and how to detect them<br/>\n\nâ¢ <a href=\"https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/5-sophisticated-job-scams-to-watch-out-for/\">Another article</a> on warning signs and so on<br/><br/>Unfortunately there doesnât seem to be any way of tracking or reporting suspected scammers that I know of, but please let me know if you find one.</p></blockquote>",
