They would fill the beaks with spices and rose petals, so they wouldnât have to smell the rotting bodies.Â </p>\n<p>A theory during the Bubonic Plague was that the plague was caused by evil spirits. To scare the spirits away, the masks were intentionally designed to be creepy.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mission fucking accomplished</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay so I love this but it doesnât cover the half of why the design is awesome and actually borders on making sense.</p>\n<p>It wasnât just that they didnât <em>want</em> to smell the infected and dead, they thought it was <em>crucial</em> to protecting themselves. They had no way of knowing about what actually caused the plague, and so one of theÂ <em>other</em> theories was that the smell of the infected all by itself was evil and could transmit the plague. So not only would they fill their masks with aromatic herbs and flowers, they would also burn fires in public areas, so that the smell of the smoke would âclear the airâ. This all related to the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory\"> miasma theory</a> of contagion, which was one of the major theories out there until the <em>19th century</em>. And it makes sense, in a way. Plague victims smelled <em>awful</em>, and thereâs a general correlation between horrible septic smells andÂ getting horribly sick if youâre around what causes them for too long.</p>\n<p>You can see now that weâve got two different theories as to what caused the plague that were worked into the design. Thatâs because the whole thing was an attempt by the doctors to cover as many bases as they could think of, and weâre still not done.</p>\n<p>The glass eyepieces. They were either darkened or <em>red</em>, not something you generally want to have to contend with when examining patients. But the plague might be spread by <em>eye contact</em> via the <a href=\"http://www.articlesbase.com/history-articles/the-plague-doctor-mask-and-its-history-3650727.html\">evil eye</a>, so best to ward that off too.</p>\n<p>The illustration shows a doctor holding a stick. This was an examination tool, that helped the doctors keep some distance between themselves and the infected. They already had gloves on, but the extra level of separation was apparently deemed necessary. You could even take a pulse with it. Or keep people the fuck away from you, which was <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=5k_lAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA639&amp;dq=beak+doctor+costume++%22plague+doctor%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Nw6STNyaDYHfnAenytCXCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CGgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=beak%20doctor%20costume%20%22plague%20doctor%22&amp;f=false\">apparently a documented use</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the robe. Itâs not just to look fancy, the cloth was waxed, as were all of the rest of their clothes. Whatâs one of the properties of wax? Water-based fluids arenât absorbed by it. This was the closest you could get to a sterile, fully protecting garment back then. Because at least one person along the line was smart enough to think âGee, Iâd <em>really</em> rather not have the stuff coming out of those weeping sores <em>anywhere on my person</em>â.</p>\n<p>So between all of these thereâs a real sense that a lot of real thought was put into making sure the doctors were protected, even if they couldnât exactly be sure from <em>what</em>. They worked with what information they had. And frankly, itâs a great design given what was available! You limit exposure to aspirated liquids, limit exposure to contaminated liquids already present, you limit contact <em>with the infected</em>. You also donât give fleas any really good place to hop onto. Thatâs actually <em>useful</em>.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, there were <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor_contract\">contracts</a> the doctors would sign before they even got <em>near</em> a patient. They were to be under quarantine themselves, they wouldnât treat patients without a custodian monitoring them and helping when something <em>had</em> to be physically contacted, and they would <em>not</em> treat non-plague patients for the duration. There was an actual <em>system</em> in place by the time the plague doctors really became a thing to make sure <em>they</em> didnât infect anyone either.</p>\n<p>These guys were the product of the scientific process at work, and the scientific process made a <em>bitchinâ proto-hazmat suit</em>. <em>And</em> containment protocols!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Plus, they look fuckinâ badass</p>\n</blockquote>",
