   "quote-text" : "<p>Olivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was seven years old. As the illness took its usual course I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it. Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldnât do anything.</p>\n\n<p>âAre you feeling all right?â I asked her.</p>\n\n<p>âI feel all sleepy, â she said.</p>\n\n<p>In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead.</p>\n\n<p>The measles had turned into a terrible thing called measles encephalitis and there was nothing the doctors could do to save her.</p>\n\n<p>That was twenty-four years ago in 1962, but even now, if a child with measles happens to develop the same deadly reaction from measles as Olivia did, there would still be nothing the doctors could do to help her.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, there is today something that parents can do to make sure that this sort of tragedy does not happen to a child of theirs. They can insist that their child is immunised against measles. I was unable to do that for Olivia in 1962 because in those days a reliable measles vaccine had not been discovered. Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it.</p>\n\n<p>It is not yet generally accepted that measles can be a dangerous illness.</p>\n\n<p>Believe me, it is. In my opinion parents who now refuse to have their children immunised are putting the lives of those children at risk.</p>\n\n<p>In America, where measles immunisation is compulsory, measles like smallpox, has been virtually wiped out.</p>\n\n<p>Here in Britain, because so many parents refuse, either out of obstinacy or ignorance or fear, to allow their children to be immunised, we still have a hundred thousand cases of measles every year.</p>\n\n<p>Out of those, more than 10,000 will suffer side effects of one kind or another.</p>\n\n<p>At least 10,000 will develop ear or chest infections.</p>\n\n<p>About 20 will die.</p>\n\n<p>LET THAT SINK IN.</p>\n\n<p>Every year around 20 children will die in Britain from measles.</p>\n\n<p>So what about the risks that your children will run from being immunised?</p>\n\n<p>They are almost non-existent. Listen to this. In a district of around 300,000 people, there will be only one child every 250 years who will develop serious side effects from measles immunisation! That is about a million to one chance. I should think there would be more chance of your child choking to death on a chocolate bar than of becoming seriously ill from a measles immunisation.</p>\n\n<p>So what on earth are you worrying about?</p>\n\n<p>It really is almost a crime to allow your child to go unimmunised.</p>",
