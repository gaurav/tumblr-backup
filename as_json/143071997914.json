   "quote-text" : "<p>When, around that time, Wall Street Journal columnist Irving Kristol coined the phrase âa neoconservative is a liberal whoâs been mugged by realityââa bowdlerization of the older adage âa conservative is a liberal whoâs been muggedââhe probably didnât have Charles Bronson in mind, let alone taxi driver Travis Bickle. Nonetheless the politics is all of a piece. Charles Bronson conservatism, Travis Bickle conservatism, the conservatism of avenging angels protecting white innocence in a Â âliberalâ metropolis gone mad: this is New York Cityâs unique contribution to the history of conservatism in America, an ideological tradition heretofore unrecognized in the historical literature. But without it, we cannot understand the rise of Donald Trump.</p>\n\n<p>Trumpâs political debut, after all, came in response to a mugging. Following the infamous attack on a female jogger in Central Park, Trump purchased full pages in four New York newspapers demanding, âBring Back the Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!â All the hallmarks of his present crusade against âpolitical correctnessâ were in evidence, such as the harkening to that bygone day when men were men, cops were cops, and punks were punks. He concluded: âI miss the feeling of security New Yorkâs finest once gave the citizens of this City.â As I previously reported, these same police straight-jacketed by liberal timorousness had already coerced the rape suspects into confessions later proven to be false.</p>\n\n<p>Thatâs N.Y.C.âs avenging-angel conservatism in a nutshell. And now that Trump is gliding toward an expected landslide in the New York primary on Tuesday, April 19, we must begin the work of excavating its history.</p>\n\n<p>We might start with William F. Buckleyâthough other scholars can surely date it back further. The National Review editorâs quixotic campaign for New York mayor in 1965 is best remembered for a self-effacing quip. (âWhat will you do if you win?â he was asked. âDemand a recount.â) Buckley himself is now celebrated as the genteel warrior of the conservatism of a more civilized age: The New York Times, upon his death in 2008, averred of that 1965 race, âHe injected a rare degree of lofty oratory into city politics.â</p>\n\n<p>What he also injected was an unprecedented reactionary thuggishness. Like his idea to âundertake to quarantine all addicts, even as smallpox carriers would be quarantined during a plague.â Or ârelocating chronic welfare cases outside the city limitsââin what his critics described as concentration camps for the poor. The campaign might have begun as a lark. He received hardly more than 10 percent of the vote. But in a harbinger of things to come, he finished second in some Catholic neighborhoods in Queens. Cops wore âBuckley For Mayorâ buttons. When the electionâs winner, the very liberal John Lindsay, campaigned in those same neighborhoods, young white men waved âSupport your Local Policeâ placards in his face.</p>",
