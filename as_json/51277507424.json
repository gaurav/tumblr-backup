   "quote-text" : "<p>In 1978, [the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Afghanistan\">Kabul Museum</a>] was known as one of the world&rsquo;s finest small museums. [..] In the late nineties, the Taliban had hammered the remaining Greco-Buddhist statues into rubble. Now, museum officials set the rubble of each sculpture on a pedestal and above each pile of rubble hung a picture of the work as it once had looked: the museum became a testament to the cultural barbarity of the Taliban.</p>\n\n<p>Then came the most astonishing announcement. In April 2004, museum director Omara Massoudi revealed that fifteen years earlier, foreseeing the troubles that were coming, he and a few associates had hidden more than twenty thousand of the museum&rsquo;s most precious artifacts in a secret vault. Archaeologists from around the world gathered to watch him open that vault. It was practically like the discovery of King Tut&rsquo;s tomb except televised. Several hundred items from that breathtaking collection later toured the world as a show called <a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/afghanistan-treasures/about.html\">The Gold of Afghanistan</a>.</p>",
