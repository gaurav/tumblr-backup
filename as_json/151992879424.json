   "quote-text" : "<p>Some of the response to the tape shows the need for such a change. Many reports focused on Mr Trumpâs vulgarity, rather than his ugly meanings. The Washington Post, which broke the story, described the recording as an âextremely lewd conversationâ; the Guardian referred to it as a âsex-boast tapeâ. Fox News said that Mr Trump âuses a vulgar anatomical term and discusses trying to have sex with an unidentified, married woman.â Mr Trumpâs defence, such as it was, took a similar tack, apologising for âlocker-room banterâ outside the locker room.</p>\n\n<p> But, as many women pointed out on social media, the really offensive word was not âpussyâ â even though, of all the demeaning words used for womenâs genitals, it is the one most commonly used to describe women collectively as sexual objects and prey. The word that stung was âgrabâ. âYou bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?â Anderson Cooper, one of the moderators of the presidential debate held in Missouri on October 9th, asked Mr Trump. Mr Trump denied any such thing. </p>\n\n<p>Responses from senior Republicans missed the mark in other ways. Many cited their wives, daughters and so on as their motivation for denouncing Mr Trumpâs words. âWomen are to be championed and revered, not objectified,â said Paul Ryan, the House Speaker, in a textbook example of what feminists call âbenevolent sexismâ: a belief in the wondrousness of women that perpetuates harm by casting them as weak.</p>",
