   "quote-text" : "If someone posts something odious to a news aggregator â that makes people in marginalized groups feel hurt, unsafe, threatened, etc. (note that I omit the word &ldquo;offense&rdquo; - it&rsquo;s abused too often to retain any useful meaning in these discussions) - and you have never been in a marginalized group, or cared deeply for someone in a marginalized group, or felt unsafe at work - then I totally understand why you&rsquo;re more likely to want to defend the person saying the odious stuff. It&rsquo;s called empathy. And what you&rsquo;re doing when you&rsquo;re defending that person is actually an act of empathy: you realize you&rsquo;re far more likely to accidentally say something hurtful on a news aggregator (or other public forum) than you are to be the target of that sort of language, and if you were ever to do that, you&rsquo;d want guys like yourself to be able to understand your perspective. You know what? That&rsquo;s a totally reasonable, and utterly human, response, and nobody&rsquo;s going to judge you for that. But it&rsquo;s also completely inappropriate to share in a larger space and frame as a logical argument. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s empathy polluting a comment feed and for people who are used to seeing this play out over and over, that &ldquo;original&rdquo; argument is tired and frankly embarrassing.",
