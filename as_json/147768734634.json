I just know it.â <br/>âOh, <i>thatâs</i> not so bad; have you heard about what Christina is going through?!â <br/>âJust think positive thoughts.â <br/>âI know just the thing to solve your problem for you: <i>(insert solution youâve already heard/tried or know already would not work </i>here<i>)</i>.âÂ </p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Or better yet, have you ever opened up to someone and then ended up having to comfort <i>them</i>Â about <i>your </i>suffering because theyâre so distraught about what you have told them?</b> You end up having to say something to the effect of,Â âItâs okay, really. Donât worry about meâ in order to move on in the conversation.</p>\n<p>I donât know about you, but as a person living with a chronic pain disorder that is (currently) incurable, I end up in conversations like these on a near daily basis. I get <i>reallyÂ </i>tired of them. I know that people have good intentions, but it can still sting to feel like Iâm not being listened to. Iâm just being <i>heard;</i>Â theyâre listening to respond rather than just listening. Theyâre trying to find answers when there just might not be answers and then feel disappointed when they canât find them. It feels like they donât understand how hard Iâm working to get better. I silver line my situation for myself all the time, but sometimes, I just need to vent.Â </p>\n<p><i>Even the most positive among us need to complain about bad days sometimes.</i></p>\n<p>Here are some things Iâm learning to say instead of âItâs okay, really. Donât worry about meâ that I think could help many of us in similar situations and awkward conversations:</p>\n<blockquote><p>âSometimes, itâs nice to just vent to someone - thanks for listening.â<br/>âEven though no one can really fix it, itâs so good to just talk about it.â<br/>âEven my team of doctors doesnât have many answers, so I certainly donât expect you to solve it! Itâs just helpful to know youâre here for me.â<br/>âMost of the time, I try to stay positive, but today Iâm just not feeling it, so itâs great to just have some support and companionship.â<br/>âI so appreciate you trying to make me feel better and see the silver lining, but itâs definitely not a great situation right now because itâs not under my control.â Â </p></blockquote>\n<p>For those of us who are religious, here are some specific responses to silver lining statements likeÂ âGod is using this for your goodâ,Â âGod is goodâ,Â âJust pray moreâ:</p>\n<blockquote><p>âIâm so grateful that we have a God who can handle our frustration, disappointment, sadness, and doubts. Today, Heâs handling a lot of those on my behalf.â<br/>âI know that God will weave all things together for my good, but today, itâs really hard to see that.â<br/>âI donât doubt His goodness, but I do sometimes doubt the good in this situation. Thanks for listening.â<br/></p></blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><figure data-tumblr-attribution=\"tinibinib:9UEf3Vc-iMbx3716vBsAfw:Z1Tipn1Q0QS0X\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"360\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"360\" src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/83820f94f498bc61e714ed053cdf3169/tumblr_nbe9s02pBT1tyhayao1_500.gif\"/></figure></p>\n</blockquote>",
