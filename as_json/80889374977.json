The Hopi lived in the arid desert and farmed communally to survive. The allotment process would sell off âexcessâ lands, reducing the overall acreage the tribe needed to survive. Also, the Hopi were a matrilineal society, meaning they traced ancestry through the mother. They were fearful that the allotment process would eventually cancel out their way of life, and that women would not have control of their own homes. Each pictogram represents a family, and every family in the tribe signed the petition.Â </p>\n<p>The government never formally responded to the petition, and the Hopiâs lands were never allotted. In an annual report from the Indian commissioner, it was recommended that the Hopis be allowed to continue their custom, âit is believed that the best interests of the tribe would be promoted by granting the petition.â</p>\n<p>(via <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/publications/ebooks/index.html#mtm\">the âMaking Their Mark: Stories Through Signaturesâ eGuide</a>)</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p><span>This petition is among the featured items at the â</span><strong><a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/nae/visit/gallery.html\">Making Their Mark: Stories Through Signatures</a></strong><span>&ldquo; exhibit now on display at the National Archives Museum.</span></p></blockquote>",
