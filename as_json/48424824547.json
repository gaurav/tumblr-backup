   "regular-body" : "<p>Here&rsquo;s a complicated thought I&rsquo;m trying to lay out on Tumblr before I turn myself into bed: I&rsquo;ve been a bit out of sorts all day, starting with the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lpolgreen/status/325141378344554497\">horrible situation in Watertown, MA</a>, but of course my comprehensive exams and the weather and everything play a part, and then I encountered my first tornado warning, which was exactly as much fun as you&rsquo;d think it&rsquo;d be, but.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve just realized that, my mind tossing on the squally waves of today, I&rsquo;ve somehow ended up talking to or at least reaching out to almost every person I&rsquo;m really close to. I missed a few, obviously, because this isn&rsquo;t me realizing that I was unhappy and reaching out to my friends for relief; this is me not even consciously realizing that I needed help but sidling towards it anyway. Even on a day like today, where my scurrilous mood bent me away from the world and back into myself, having people around me who understand and sympathize and care really is, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s really both that it&rsquo;s that important, even though I&rsquo;d never acknowledge it as such, but it&rsquo;s also really just that <em>easy</em>, that I can do it with one mind tied behind my back. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting that.\n</p>\n\n<p>This is new for me. I&rsquo;m pretty used to taking care of myself, but I didn&rsquo;t expect by subconscious to do it for me.\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reply</strong>: Thanks for the comments, friendly people :). sometime.*: I can only agree *grin*. dghost: Me too, on both counts! I knew I had a lot of friends &ndash; the whole period since I got to the US has been really good to me friendwise, especially December 2012. The other thing is new; I don&rsquo;t know if I hadn&rsquo;t noticed because I haven&rsquo;t been stressed without also noticing that I&rsquo;m stressed, or because that particular switch hadn&rsquo;t been turned on in my head, or what. Either way, it&rsquo;s a good thing!\n</p>",
