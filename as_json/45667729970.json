   "quote-text" : "The fact that youâre struggling doesnât make you a burden. It doesnât make you unloveable or undesirable or undeserving of care. It doesnât make you too much or too sensitive or too needy. It makes you human. Everyone struggles. Everyone has a difficult time coping, and at times, we all fall apart. During these times, we arenât always easy to be around â and thatâs okay. No one is easy to be around one hundred percent of the time. Yes, you may sometimes be unpleasant or difficult. And yes, you may sometimes do or say things that make the people around you feel helpless or sad. But those things arenât all of who you are and they certainly donât discount your worth as a human being. The truth is that you can be struggling and still be loved. You can be difficult and still be cared for. You can be less than perfect, and still be deserving of compassion and kindness.",
