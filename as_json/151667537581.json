   "quote-source" : "Democracy in America, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2013/04/george-w-bushs-legacy\"><em>George W. Bush&rsquo;s legacy: Still the guy who taught America to torture</em>, The Economist, April 26, 2013.</a>",
   "quote-text" : "<p>There may be some issues on which George W. Bush was &ldquo;centrist and establishmentarian&rdquo;, but his stances on civil liberties and the war on terror were not among them. The only reason they may appear so now is that the Bush administration and the Republican Party succeeded in shifting the political debate so far towards militarism and unchecked security-statism in the previous decade that it now feels normal. We&rsquo;ve been right so long it looks like centre to us. It is hard to tell how much personal responsibility Mr Bush bears for many of the most egregious precedent-setting violations of human rights that took place during his tenure, since he was a relatively ill-informed and often disengaged chief executive who delegated an unusual level of power in these areas to his vice-president. But we were talking about the administration, not just the man. On civil liberties, it was the Bush administration that decided that America ought to torture people and imprison them without trial indefinitely (ie, possibly forever) in extra-territorial jails. On the war on terror, it was the Bush administration that decided that America ought to launch preemptive wars against other countries in defiance of international public opinion, based on a delusional belief in the irresistible glory and rightness of American power. I would call that radical and right-wing. I can think of some meaner words, too.</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;] Torture is a crime against humanity. America has signed treaties that oblige it to try its own officials when they commit crimes against humanity. And yet you can feel how far the Bush administration moved politics permanently to the right when you speak the words &ldquo;officials who ordered people tortured should be tried for crimes against humanity&rdquo;, and realise that you sound like a ranting far-left extremist. [&hellip;]</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;] Either way, it&rsquo;s absurd to believe that America would have started torturing people or invading countries unprovoked if Barack Obama, Al Gore, Bill Clinton or George H.W. Bush had been in the White House on September 11th, 2001. That is George W. Bush&rsquo;s historical responsibility, and it&rsquo;s what he should be remembered forâalong with the financial crisis, the rich-skewed tax cuts that left us with a half-trillion-dollar structural deficit, the listless cronyism that hollowed out the SEC and FEMA, a couple of positive public-health initiatives marred by corporate giveaways (PEPFAR, Medicare Part D), and the decision to doom the world to global warming by opposing the Kyoto Protocol. On balance, a legacy worthy of contempt.</p>",
