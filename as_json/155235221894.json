   "regular-body" : "<p>It&rsquo;s been a long year, with much to do and much left undone. And then it ended, which is what years do, after all, and I&rsquo;m still here. Well, no, I&rsquo;m no longer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado\">here</a>, but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida\">there</a>, and it&rsquo;s warm, not cold, and dry, not snowy; and I&rsquo;ve reached the end of the tape and I&rsquo;m moving on and on and &hellip;\n\nIt&rsquo;s been a long year, with much to do and much left undone. But so much did happen! I traveled back to India and got my visa renewed. I attended conferences in Costa Rica and Texas and Arizona and visited family in New Mexico and saw the wilderness at De-Na-Zin and drove around there and in the snow and to the Rocky Mountain National Park (EDIT: also sand dunes. There were definitely sand dunes and muddy streams and moonlit rivers). I discovered some great podcasts (<em>The West Wing Weekly</em>, <em>The Axe Files</em>, <em>The Writer&rsquo;s Voice</em>), saw some great TV (<em>Broadchurch</em>, <em>Hack/Sign</em>, <em>Dexter</em>, <em>Green Wing</em>, <em>Bates Motel</em>, <em>Better Call Saul</em>, <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em>, <em>Marvel&rsquo;s Angels of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em>, <em>Orange is the New Black</em>, <em>The Fall</em>, <em>Supergirl</em>, <em>Once Upon A Time</em>, and a last-minute discovery, <em>Doctor Foster</em>). There&rsquo;s been some great computer games (<a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/271240/\">Offworld Trading Company</a> and <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/446800/\">Transport Fever</a> in particular). Not enough books and not enough movies, but maybe that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ll be able to fix in the year ahead. And it&rsquo;s a taken a lot &mdash; a lot of friendship and a lot of love and I lot of strength and a lot of energy and some sacrifice and concern and &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, whatever it is you need to survive in this crazy world.\n\nIt&rsquo;s been a long year, with much to do and much left undone, and next year is going to be longer still. My PhD is ending! There is travel to plan! There is postdoc work to do! There will be conferences to attend, meetings to get to and back from, cars to drive, people to visit. There will be games and friends and story and light and life and (here&rsquo;s hoping) as little warmth as physically possible.\n\nIt&rsquo;s been a long year, with much to do and so much left undone. But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6VrKro8djw\">I&rsquo;m on my way. Taking my time, and I don&rsquo;t know where</a> &ndash; but I am on my way. Happy 2017, everybody. Let&rsquo;s all make it to 2018 together!</p>",
