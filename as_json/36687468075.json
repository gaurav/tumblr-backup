   "quote-text" : "<p>It also reminds me of a trip to a Music Information Retrieval conference a couple of years back. Every other session was accompanied by a click track and seemed to be another attempt to improve &ldquo;onset beat detection&rdquo; in some exotic music genre by two or three percent. I&rsquo;m no musicologist but it felt like a strange approach to determining meaning from music. If you were ever asked to describe punk or hip-hop or acid house I doubt you&rsquo;d start with chord sequences or rhythm patterns. For at least some genres the context of the culture and the politics (and the narcotics) feels like a better starting point.</p>\n\n<p>So I think when we throw machines at the analysis part there&rsquo;s a tendency to reduce down the ineffable to a meaningless set of atoms. Or a pile of salt. Machines have their place but it&rsquo;s their usual place: boring, repetitive tasks at speed.</p>\n\n<p>Getting back to the diagram: once archive items are digitised, contextualised, findable and in the web they become social objects. People can link to them, share them, &ldquo;curate&rdquo; them, annotate them, analyse them, celebrate them, debunk them, take them, repurpose them, &ldquo;remix&rdquo; them and make new things from them.</p>",
