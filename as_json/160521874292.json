   "quote-text" : "<p>Even more elaborate measures were called for in 1998 after a gyroscope malfunction on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) probe, a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). SOHO was designed to monitor solar activity, but lost its lock on the sun, went into an emergency mode and began spinning uncontrollably, losing power as it did so.</p>\n\n<p>The probe was slowly spinning, with sunlight falling on its solar panels once a minute, causing its computer to boot up for 25 seconds each time. SOHOâs controllers sent control sequences to it thousands of times a day, at various frequencies, for six weeks, ordering the probe to switch on its transmitter so that they could tell that commands were getting through. Eventually it did so, and the controllers told it to charge its batteries so it could stay on for more than a few seconds at a time.</p>\n\n<p>Once the batteries had been charged, it was possible to download telemetry from SOHO. This revealed that the propulsion systems used to stabilise the craft were in shadow and had frozen solid. Thawing SOHOâs 200kg of hydrazine fuel involved a repeating cycle of turning on its heaters and then recharging its batteries, gradually raising the temperature of the tank each time. Eventually a command sequence was sent which enabled SOHO to stabilise itself using its warmed-up thrusters.</p>\n\n<p>The probe was then reprogrammed to operate without two of its three gyroscopes, and its scientific instruments were gradually brought back online. Having survived this three-month crisis, SOHO has continued to operate ever since, far exceeding its design life of two years. âItâs engineering, really hard engineering,â said Bernhard Fleck of the ESA, the head of the SOHO science team, after the probeâs recovery. âYou have to try the impossible.â</p>",
