The first eagle you get is always declawed, which I always thought was pretty inhumane, but it was a good way to ease into caring for the birds. My eagle (named Baldy, because I wasnât a terribly clever child) was already quite old when I received him (he was a rescue eagle, luckily) but I did have him until I was 16. I donât know if I was more excited about getting my drivers license that year, or my new eagle! You should have seen the party we had when I got him, too! Grilled hot dogs and fire works and lemonadeâ¦. obviously I named my beautiful new eagle Freedom. Heâs too big to keep inside anymore, unfortunately, but weâve got a pretty comfortable roost for him on our apartmentâs balcony.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ah, yes, the eagle ceremony! My Justice and I remember his quite well. (They had just come out with telepathic link transplants when I got him, which is how I know he remembers it.) Our celebration was quite modest, compared to Freedomâsâapple pie under a cloudless summer sky as we signed our Declaration of Interdependence. I still have the inked and talon-pierced document hanging on my wall.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>what is thisÂ </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Get out Canada</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was so scared during my pet eagle ceremony I almost threw up. But Stonewall Jackson and I have been best friends ever since. My dad and grandfather built a really massive roost behind the house for my eagle and my sistersâ eagles. Stonewall always waits for me when I get home from class since schools are getting so over protective and strict these days and wonât allow eagles indoors. Which just goes to show how much weâre bubble wrapping kids today. Back in the day, if you couldnât handle a few stitches because you pissed off the wrong kidâs eagle, you had to just man up and learn your lesson!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ooo, I never miss a chance to tell this story! I had a rather unusual first eagle ceremony. The traditional giant American flag that you wave around to summon your eagle had been severely damaged the week prior (a ceremony that had not gone according to plan, but the child only suffered minor talon wounds. The flag took the brunt of the attack).Â  Anyway, I couldnât use the normal flag so we had to search ALL OVER for one suitable for eagle summoning. Unfortunately the stripes werenât the correct shade of patriotic red so everyone was worried an eagle wouldnât show up at all.Â  I had to stand in the middle of that wheat field, the wind creating amber waves out of it, shaking that flag in the air for over three hours.Â  Everyone was just about to give up when suddenly Patriot appeared out of nowhere!Â  He came to me so quickly it was like he was apologizing for being late.Â  And weâve been together ever since.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh, I loved the eagle ceremony! Mine wasnât special to say the least, but I did end up naming my eagle Liberty.Â MyÂ nephew will have his own eagle ceremony soon, Iâm super excited. Maybe his eagle and mine can be best friends? Oh, I sure hope so. Thatâd be cool!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Honestly, I think the eagle ceremony is the best part of growing up in the states. I remember getting my first eagle. Feathers was my first friend. He had a bad wing but he kept trying to fly no matter what he did. I would help him and we even made him a little perch with stairs. He taught me a lot. There isnât a day that goes by that I donât miss my eagle. My parents are looking to get me another one. Oh, I hope they hurry up!!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I got my Eagle Last year, the ceremony was w.e. I dropped the flag, and everyone yelled at me, and the potato salad wasnât that great but my cousin brought McDonalds and ever since I hand fed my eagle Bill his first fry he became addicted to them; theyâre his favorite treat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I remember my eagle ceremony! I got the biggest flag possible (and that I could still hold up and wave proudly) so to get a larger eagle. I had heard this was a myth but then Liberty flew out from behind the clouds. It was spectacularÂ really, she has a big wingspan and she showed it off nicely. We hung out by the pool cooking hot dogs, burgers, and apple pie for dessert for the ceremony. We have a rather large tree in my backyard for her to safely and cheaply roost. Overall it was a good day!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wow, this is bringing back memories! My eagle ceremony was actually really odd compared to the ones above. See, we canât switch the date of our ceremony, that would be very un-American. So, there I was, out in the pouring rain, wet to the bone, my parents behind me with my brother. The flag I used was tiny. I was foolish and thought that the size of the flag was unimportant, but is was important. Though, not as important as the singing of the Star Spangled Banner by my family. I waved my tiny flag as hard as I could against the cold rain for what felt like hours until my tiny eagle showed up. My mother was so sad at her size, but I thought she was perfect. She fluttered right onto my arm and stared at me. It was then that I named her Justice. I have loved her ever since.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ah the Eagle Ceremony, truly a right of passage. I thought to myself how I could get the most patriotic eagle of them all, and then it hit me! The 4th of July! I had my Eagle on good old Independence Day, with the fireworks bursting all around, waving my american flag, wafting the sent of all-american hot dogs over the purple mountains in all their majesty, and there he flew, and landed right in front of me, and took my hot dog right out of my hand. I had to give him the best name I could think of, so I named him after the best country on Jesusâ green Earth. I named him American Hero, and his been my sidekick ever since.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My eagle ceremony was the best day of my life. McDonaldâs did the catering, and the room in which the reception was held was beautifully adorned with American flags, which reminded me of how much I love our country. After I recited the Pledge ofÂ Allegiance,Â I named my eagle Jesus W. Romney, after all of my favorite people, and we are definitely the best of friends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I remember my eagle ceremony. I was so worried. It had been storming all day, the flag could barely fly. It was soaked. I stood out there for a good two hours trying to wave a soaking flag. I almost thought I would be the only kid to not get an Eagle. I was just starting to wind down when I heard the most beautiful sound. An Eagle, who I later named Justice ( Iâve never been good with naming. Justice is an oldie but a goody), called out to me. He appeared over the trees and he flew over to me. He shook off the rain. I shook my head to get rid of the rain too and weâve been buddies since. Heâs getting rather old so I think his time is coming. I hope my next eagle is as great as Justice is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Who would win in a Bald Eagle/Owl/Owlbear/Dropbear fight? Discuss.</p>",
