   "quote-text" : "<p>He didnât say much, just for us to go meet with him in his office. When we got there, he told us our baby had anencephaly, a condition that prevents normal development of the brain and bones of the skull. We had choices, he said. We could carry the baby to term, and it would not live after birth. Or we could end the pregnancy now, either by dilation and evacuation or inducing delivery. I donât remember the details except for exactly what I was wearing: a fashionable navy skirt and green top that I could still squeeze into and show my baby bump.</p>\n\n<p>The doctor gave me a number to call if we decided to end the pregnancy. I didnât realize that the phone number was for an abortion clinic, until I heard the hold message: that one in three women will have an abortion by age 45. And it hit me. I was going to have an abortion.</p>\n\n<p>When the day finally came, my husband and I had our plan, directions, and instructions on what to bring and wear. Still, I wasnât really prepared. Iâd heard about bombings and shootings at Planned Parenthood facilities on the news. But I wasnât ready for the police and security at the door during what was, for me, an already horrible, scary, and extreme life event. I felt like a criminal going into a secret place in the early hours of the morning. No men were allowed in the back of the clinicânot even partners or companions. I get this from a policy and safety standpoint, but I was going to have to be alone?</p>\n\n<p>And I hadnât seen up close how our laws try to shame women. Iâd read policy papers about lawmakers forcing women to listen to their fetusesâ heartbeat before an abortion, but there I was faced with signing the paper asking me if I âchose to not see my baby before it was aborted.â I broke down. I was not âchoosingâ to do this. What was going on? Was this real life?</p>",
