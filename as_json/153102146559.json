   "quote-text" : "<p>After learning my flight was detained 4 hours,<br/>\nI heard the announcement:<br/>\nIf anyone in the vicinity of gate 4-A understands any Arabic,<br/>\nPlease come to the gate immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Wellâone pauses these days. Gate 4-A was my own gate. I went there.<br/>\nAn older woman in full traditional Palestinian dress,<br/>\nJust like my grandma wore, was crumpled to the floor, wailing loudly.<br/>\nHelp, said the flight service person. Talk to her. What is her<br/>\nProblem? we told her the flight was going to be four hours late and she<br/>\nDid this.</p>\n\n<p>I put my arm around her and spoke to her haltingly.<br/>\nShu dow-a, shu- biduck habibti, stani stani schway, min fadlick,<br/>\nSho bit se-wee?</p>\n\n<p>The minute she heard any words she knewâhowever poorly usedâ<br/>\nShe stopped crying.</p>\n\n<p>She thought our flight had been canceled entirely.<br/>\nShe needed to be in El Paso for some major medical treatment the<br/>\nFollowing day. I said no, no, weâre fine, youâll get there, just late,</p>\n\n<p>Who is picking you up? Letâs call him and tell him.<br/>\nWe called her son and I spoke with him in English.<br/>\nI told him I would stay with his mother till we got on the plane and<br/>\nWould ride next to herâSouthwest.</p>\n\n<p>She talked to him. Then we called her other sons just for the fun of it.</p>\n\n<p>Then we called my dad and he and she spoke for a while in Arabic and<br/>\nFound out of course they had ten shared friends.</p>\n\n<p>Then I thought just for the heck of it why not call some Palestinian<br/>\nPoets I know and let them chat with her. This all took up about 2 hours.</p>\n\n<p>She was laughing a lot by then. Telling about her life. Answering<br/>\nQuestions.</p>\n\n<p>She had pulled a sack of homemade mamool cookiesâlittle powdered<br/>\nSugar crumbly mounds stuffed with dates and nutsâout of her bagâ<br/>\nAnd was offering them to all the women at the gate.</p>\n\n<p>To my amazement, not a single woman declined one. It was like a<br/>\nSacrament. The traveler from Argentina, the traveler from California,<br/>\nThe lovely woman from Laredoâwe were all covered with the same<br/>\nPowdered sugar. And smiling. There are no better cookies.</p>\n\n<p>And then the airline broke out the free beverages from huge coolersâ<br/>\nNon-alcoholicâand the two little girls for our flight, one African<br/>\nAmerican, one Mexican Americanâran around serving us all apple juice<br/>\nAnd lemonade and they were covered with powdered sugar too.</p>\n\n<p>And I noticed my new best friendâby now we were holding handsâ<br/>\nHad a potted plant poking out of her bag, some medicinal thing,</p>\n\n<p>With green furry leaves. Such an old country traveling tradition. Always<br/>\nCarry a plant. Always stay rooted to somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>And I looked around that gate of late and weary ones and thought,<br/>\nThis is the world I want to live in. The shared world.</p>\n\n<p>Not a single person in this gateâonce the crying of confusion stopped<br/>\nâhas seemed apprehensive about any other person.</p>\n\n<p>They took the cookies. I wanted to hug all those other women too.<br/>\nThis can still happen anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Not everything is lost.</p>",
