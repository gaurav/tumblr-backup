   "regular-body" : "<p><a href=\"http://vampireapologist.tumblr.com/post/171770161528/i-started-straightening-my-hair-in-middle-school\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">vampireapologist</a>:</p><blockquote>\n<p>I started straightening my hair in middle school bc my haircut was specifically styled for someone with straight hair and Iâd wake up two hours early every morning to straighten it one layer at a time and if I accidentally overslept Iâd have a full-on meltdown because I felt too ugly to go to school.</p>\n<p>When I graduated high school and didnât have the time to straighten it anymore, I cut it all off and kept it in a pixie for four years. I never felt good about it. Every few months Iâd decide to grow it out, but the minute it got past my ears and started to wave a little, I had it lopped again.</p>\n<p>In 8th grade I got my track uniform for the day of my first ever meet. I put on the tank top and looked around and noticed all of the other girls had smooth armpits. Mortified, I lied and told themÂ âuhâ¦.I forgot to shave today,â but really I didnât even know you were <i>supposed</i>Â to shave your armpits. They saidÂ âit canât be that badâ but grimaced when I showed them the hair. I was teased so badly that I lost a race I would have won because I was too afraid to pump my arms too high while I ran and reveal my armpit hair.<br/></p>\n<p>In middle school a stylist told me my eyebrows looked like âcarpetsâ on my face, and she waxed them into thin lines them even while I sat crying and crying âno no no no no donât pleaseâ because I was afraid it would hurt and because I didnât mind my unibrow. After a year I started scheduling waxings myself, because I thought thatâs how I liked them. It wasnât until I was well into adulthood that I realized I hadnât been happy with my face since I was 13.<br/></p>\n<p>I used to tell myselfÂ âI waxed my brows like that because itâs what was in,â orÂ âI shave my armpits because thatâs whatâs normal.â</p>\n<p>But the truth is, I was literally Forced to undergo public hair removal while I cried and begged not to be, because adults decided it was high time I start fitting into what is consideredÂ âattractive,â even as a child, even though it would mean pain and lost sleep and mornings full of tears and years spent learning how to actually feel good.</p>\n<p>And these are just the experiences of a little white girl growing up trying to follow whatever ridiculous rules are set for her and her hair. I cannot speak for or even begin to imagine what it is like to grow up as a child of color trying to navigate hair politics.<br/></p>\n<p>Iâm not really trying to make a statement here. Iâm just discussing out loud my recent realization that for about ten years I only did to my body what other people said looked good, and I was never happy until I stopped and started doing to my body what makes me feel good instead.</p>\n<p>Growing up is weird.</p>\n</blockquote>",
