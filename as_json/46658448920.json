   "quote-text" : "<p>And they do need it. The 17-year dearth of government-funded research, and a parallel chill on collection of gun-related data by US agencies, have left politicians without the most rudimentary information needed to inform policy-making. Consider, for instance, that the most recent Department of Justice data on the proportion of gun sales occurring between private individuals &ndash; as opposed to sales by licensed dealers &ndash; date to 1994. Not since 2004 has the CDC included firearms-related questions in its Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System questionnaire, an instrument used to shape state policies. The number of academic publications relevant to firearm violence has fallen by 60% since peaking in 1996, according to an analysis by the coalition Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which looked at trends from 1960 to 2010.</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The irony is that the gun lobby and its congressional allies might benefit from rigorous research. Would a robust study reveal that state laws allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons have resulted in more or fewer deaths? We don&rsquo;t know. Would the spiking homicide rate in Chicago, Illinois, be higher still if it were not for the city&rsquo;s restrictive gun laws, or are those laws ineffective? We don&rsquo;t know. Does a limit on assault weapons reduce the overall rate of firearms injuries and deaths? We don&rsquo;t know.</p>",
