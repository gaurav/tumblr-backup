   "quote-source" : "<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/04/john-derbyshire-and-trayvon-martin\"><em>Back to prejudice</em></a>, advocating the use of &ldquo;racial prejudice&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;racism&rdquo;, from the <em>Democracy in America</em> blog of The Economist.",
   "quote-text" : "I think the term &ldquo;racial prejudice&rdquo; evades a lot of these pitfalls. Whatever else Mr Derbyshire&rsquo;s column was, it was prima facie a document that both displayed and advocated racial prejudice. Mr Derbyshire says he literally advised his children to pre-judge black people, to treat them differently than white people based on the colour of their skin. In the Trayvon Martin case, use of the term &ldquo;racism&rdquo; leaves a lot of people wondering who the racist is supposed to be. The case that the shooting involved &ldquo;racial prejudice&rdquo;, that things were vanishingly unlikely to turn out the same way if Mr Martin had been white, is much easier to make. Racial prejudice embraces most of the situations we talk about when we talk about racial conflicts these days.",
