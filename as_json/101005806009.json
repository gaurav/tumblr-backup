   "answer" : "<p><strong>&ldquo;got better and apologised a few days later, he said he didnât want to be with me. Weâd been so stupidly in love up till then. I donât know how to explain to him that Iâm better and I wonât put pressure on him again. I donât know why I broke up with him that night- but I didnât mean it. Heâs had depression too, is even taking medication and attending counselling, so he must understand in some ways. What can I say to make him change his mind? I feel so ashamed for not taking control of myself.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Itâs really difficult to battle with depression, because sometimes in a dark moment we believe things which we know arenât true when weâre not feeling that way. In that moment, when you were feeling so awful and rejected and ashamed, you probably really did feel like there was no point being with him, but that was your depression talking, not your true self.Â </span></p>\n<p><span>Thereâs only so much you can do to âchange his mindâ - he was hurt by what happened (even though you were speaking under the influence of your depressive episode), and heâs allowed to feel hurt, just like you are allowed to feel hurt by him not letting you come over. You are both entitled to your feelings. Itâs important that you acknowledge what heâs feeling and let him know that you respect that.Â </span></p>\n<p><span>Itâs awful when weâre affected by mental states that cause us to act out of character. Itâs not fair, but we are still responsible for our actions when weâre in that state. Itâs really important that you have honest communication with your partner about what your depressive episodes look like and how youâre likely to behave, so they can be prepared and know how to support you.Â </span></p>\n<p><span>Hereâs the hard part though: sometimes the people we love <em>canât</em> support us. When weâre in a depressive episode, we may be desperate for comfort, love and support, but everyone is responsible for communicating their own needs openly and honestly. When you were in your depressive episode, you were honest about what you felt you needed - you were feeling low and felt like being with your boyfriend would help you to feel better. But he was honest about what he needed too - for whatever reason, he knew that in that moment he wasnât able to offer you the support that you needed. It hurts, but he was doing the best he could to take care of his own needs. We can only start to support each other and attend to other peoplesâ needs once we have attended to our own, otherwise we burn out. </span></p>\n<p><span>At that moment in time, your needs and your boyfriendâs needs were unfortunately incompatible. It <strong>sucks</strong>, believe me I know it sucks. I had so many times in my last relationship when I was in a depressive episode and desperately wanted closeness and love from my girlfriend to make me feel better, but she wasnât in a good place to provide that. She felt like my depression was bringing her down, and I felt so guilty about that. She didnât want to resent me for making her stay and look after me when she felt like she didnât have the energy for that. So she told me âI donât have the emotional energy for this. I know you need support, but I canât give that to you right nowâ. It was so hard to hear because she was the person I was closest to, but I had to respect that she was looking after herself. So I turned to other people in my life for support - friends and family that I could just spend some time with to get me through. Do I wish my girlfriend had been able to support me unconditionally? Of course I do. But I had to accept her limitations and respect her choice to take care of herself.Â </span></p>\n<p><span>Now that youâve come out of your episode, you are obviously in a much better position to communicate. It may turn out that your boyfriend feels too hurt to get back together right now, and that will hurt, or it may turn out that he just needs some time to process whatâs happened. The best thing you can do is be honest about what happened, acknowledge and accept responsibility for the things you said, acknowledge his feelings, and listen to him. If he needs space to process, let him do that. If he needs to talk, let him talk. Let him know that how heâs feeling is important. And if you do decide to work through this and get back together, work on how you can better handle your depressive episodes in the future. Make a commitment to listen to each otherâs requests for support, but also to respect each othersâ needs. Make sure you have a support network outside of your boyfriend so that when he isnât able to be there for you, you still feel like you have someone you can turn to.Â </span></p>\n<p><span>I know this is hard sweetheart. Living with mental illness means that we have to deal with some wretched situations that might not come up otherwise. But you are strong enough to get through this. Look after yourself, and make sure you have support.Â </span></p>\n\n<p><span>All my love,Â </span></p>\n<p><span>Khale xox</span></p>",

Mostly admitting I was feeling awful. He was really busy so he couldn&#039;t see me much. One night he wouldn&#039;t let me come over because my negativity was bringing him down too, and I had said insensitive things. I felt so rejected yet ashamed (he had a point) that I said didn&#039;t want to be with him. He was hurt and took that as a break-up. When I",
