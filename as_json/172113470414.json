   "quote-text" : "This year, we observe the 100th anniversary of the graduation of Lucile Berkeley Buchanan, the first African American woman to earn a degree from CU. This occasion should have been a source of pride. It is not.<br/><br/>\nThe daughter of slaves emancipated in Virginia, Buchanan was born in 1884 in Denver. When she graduated from CU in 1918, Buchananâs mother, two sisters and a niece came to campus to watch. But she was not allowed to accept her diploma on the Macky Auditorium stage, as white graduates did. She is not pictured in the yearbook, as white alumni were.<br/><br/>\nStung by the rejection, Buchanan left CU and vowed never to return. âShe kept her promise,â writes Polly McLean, an associate professor of media studies in the CU Boulder College of Media, Communication and Information. McLean, who spent a decade researching Buchananâs long-overlooked life, has written a biography of Buchanan.<br/><br/>\nThe 13th Amendment raised hopes of equality for African Americans, but those hopes were repeatedly crushed. Reconstruction preceded the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, the barbarous Jim Crow South and the racism that haunts America five decades after LBJ signed the Civil Rights Act.<br/><br/>\nFor Buchanan, this was not history. It was life. In 1899, racism drove Buchananâs sister to suicide. In 1913, racists lynched a black man in Hot Springs, Ark., where Buchanan was a school teacher. And within seven years of Buchananâs CU graduation, the Klan controlled Coloradoâs government.<br/><br/>\nDuring Buchananâs lifetime, CU never acknowledged her place in its history. It had ample time to do so. She lived to be 105 and suffered obscurity even in death. She was buried in an unmarked grave.",
