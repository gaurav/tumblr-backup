Regardless, 24 months, (I just finished my Sophomore year of Grownup Life) is enough time to learn a number of things that they canât (or at least didnât) teach in college.<br/><br/><strong>10. Being talented doesnât mean you get work.</strong></p>\n<p>This is probably the suckiest thing to realize. Thereâs a lot more to the needs of an art director than perfect composition and line weight. They have to consider markets, among various other things. So, even if they like it, you arenât automatically getting a job.</p>\n<p><strong>9. You have to sacrifice. A lot.</strong></p>\n<p>I promise itâs worth it, but you do need to be prepared to change the diaper on someone elseâs child for a year or so, or maybe work a cash register for a while. It can get tough, but you appreciate every accomplishment just that much more.</p>\n<p>Something you shouldnât be willing to sacrifice, though, is your worth as an artist. So many people will say, âPaint this for me. I canât pay you, but itâll be a great portfolio piece.&rdquo; Unless you know with certainty that itâs going to getting you places, just say NO!</p>\n<p><strong>8. People arenât usually mean about your workâ they just give the silent treatment.</strong></p>\n<p>For living in such a media-centric world, people sure are bad about answering emails. I canât begin to tell you how many Iâve never heard a reply from. Learning not to take it personally is a different kind of thick skin than the kind in college critiques- nobodyâs saying anything to your face most of the time.</p>\n<p><strong>7. You need to be in googly-eyed-love with your studio. &lt;3</strong></p>\n<p>Well, ideally. Youâll be spending a lot of time in there!Â </p>\n<p><strong>6. Youâre free to experiment with your work without the chains of grades!</strong>Â </p>\n<p>The world was wide open for me to perfect my style, without worries of being told it was âtoo&quot; anything. You have to work harder to find inspirations, since everything was at your fingertips in school, but nobodyâs watching over your shoulder to see how youâre doing.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Youâre also free to slack off and forget to paint for six months.</strong></p>\n<p>Like I said- nobodyâs watching over your shoulder to see how youâre doing. Itâs been sad to see how many folks I graduated with arenât producing their beautiful work anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Networking is literally the most important thing you can do for your career.</strong></p>\n<p>Oh man, I cannot stress this enough! Networking can be just like the domino effect. One person you meet can lead to another, and another, and another. I went to just one SCBWI meeting, and met Marsha, who asked me to join the Girllustrators. Then, I was volunteering at an event with the group, and met a notable author/illustrator, who digitally introduced me to his agent. This man encouraged me to go to the annual SCBWI conference, where I met him and many other people, which has opened so many professional doors. This is just one example. Donât be afraid to show up solo to an event, or introduce yourself to someone in the field. Even if youâre shy, itâs possible (speaking from experience)!</p>\n<p><strong>3. People might begin to think youâre stupidly dedicated to your field.</strong></p>\n<p>Theyâre usually nice about it, but you can tell they wonder why you keep trying to freelance, and donât get a âreal&quot; job. Thatâs just a sign youâre on the right track, so donât feel discouraged. (Unless you havenât paid rent in a while, of course.)</p>\n<p><strong>2. Your community is the greatest thing you could ask for.</strong></p>\n<p>Theyâll give you support, encouragement, connections, and tough love. You need them!</p>\n<p><strong>1. Always keep in mind your balance: do you live to work, or work to live?Â </strong></p>\n<p>Battling hard for that career is important, but donât lose yourself to it. Explore the world, too, because nowâs the time. Youâre broke, but youâre also free. Always remember to keep balance.</p>\n<p>-Caitlin<br/><br/>Illustrations by Caitlin B.
