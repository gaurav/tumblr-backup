It used to just be one question, like âRate the quality of the match, one to five stars.â And that was fine. We could correlate those responses to various in-game behaviors, and see what people were doing, and see what kinds of qualities of matches led to good behaviors and so forth. And that was fine.</em></p>\n<p><em>But what we changed a bit a little more recently was added a couple more questions. So we added, âPlease rate how cooperative your teammates were, one to five stars,â you know, not at all cooperative to very cooperative. We also added a third question, which was, âRate how cooperative you were as a teammate.â And this was the important one.</em></p>\n<p><em>I honestly donât care if you lie. All of us want to think highly of ourselves, so thereâs going to be a natural inclination to want to put, say, âHey, I was really cooperative as a teammate.â</em></p>\n<p><em>Whatâs going to happen, though, is that if you rate yourself really highly as a teammate, âYeah, Iâm a five-star teammateâ but you werenât, because you know that you were being a dick in the game, youâre going to go into what psychologists like to call cognitive dissonance. When youâre holding two conflicting notions in mind, right? One, that you were actually a bad teammate, and two, that you rated yourself highly as a good teammate.</em></p>\n<p><em>Youâre going to want to answer the question honestly. Youâre going to want to actually rate yourself accurately as a good teammate, so the hope is that because you had this dissonance between how you want to rate yourself and how you actually behaved, itâs going to push your behavior more towards wanting to be a more cooperative teammate.</em></p>\n<p><em>So we actually saw, once we put those questions in the game, is that the number of reports in-game went down by about 10 to 15 percent.âÂ </em></p>\n<p>- Mike Ambinder</p>\n</blockquote>",
