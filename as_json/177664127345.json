If youâreÂ âscammingâ me for some Tyson chicken and apple juice and cauliflower, then just take my fucking money.Â </p>\n<p>âA scamâ people are fucking wild.Â Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This happened to me, too. A woman had used WIC for the majority of her stuff (which I say from personal experience is such a long and embarrassing process) and to buy the remainder of her groceries, which included diapers and wipes, she used a card, and it got declined. I bought the other $30 of her groceries because hey, Iâve been there, and now Iâm not. She was extremely emotional and began to cry and even hugged me. My mom called me on the drive home and could tell I had been crying myself, asked what was wrong, and when I told her what happened, she berated me for being âduped.â I couldnât believe she could be so disappointed in one of her children for doing something- nice? Is that the hill you want to die on? Getting mad about people needing groceries?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I once paid for a womanâs bill at the vetâ¦it wasnât a big one, but she was trying to pay for some medication for her dog, and her card was declined. And her lip started trembling, and she saysÂ âI donât get paid until Tuesday, would he be ok until then?âÂ </p>\n<p>So I just told them to add the $20 something onto my bill, and I thought she was going to break down crying right there.</p>\n<p>And I donât care if it was a scam or not. Just do nice things for people sometimes.Â </p>\n</blockquote>",
