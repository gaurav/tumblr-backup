What piece(s) of art (painting, sculpture, lithograph, etc.) related to history you most like most?</strong></li>\n</ul><p>i struggled with this one bc i really, really love art and i have a lot of faves, but the thing that always tops the list is Goyaâs Disasters of War</p>\n<p>i mean HOLY FUCK those pictures are incredible.Â go wiki them if you donât know them! i think seeing them on a screen doesnât really do them justice -bc they are super impactful in real life and really emotive and arresting. also they cover a very interesting period in history ~</p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Disasters_of_War\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Disasters_of_War</a></span></p>\n<p><span>honourable mentions to everything made during the Renaissance, everything ever made in the ancient world esp all the statues with their immaculate marble booties, everything in the National Gallery, Hieronymous Boschâs stuff, Â and also the royal crown of Hungary.Â </span><span><br/></span></p>\n<p><span>OH ALSO</span></p>\n<p><span><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/d692812a4b79dd446b95506af01aea67/tumblr_inline_n5labtKYl21r1tibn.jpg\"/></span></p>\n<p><span>THIS PIC OF HERNY WRIOTHESELY who had exactly my hair at the time</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>25. Who do you consider to be the most overrated historical figure?</span></strong></p>\n<p>Napoleon is overrated tbh, i donât find him very compelling -JFK too. my grandfather wrote a book on Nelson and hated him by the end.Â also Henry Kissinger, and pretty much everyone glorified by their involvement in the British Empire.Â </p>\n<p>i also think Marie Antionette is a bit over-exposed? yes tragic, but there are a lot of really interesting queens out thereÂ !Â </p>\n<p>gosh SORRY FOR RAMBLING, and thank you for asking xxÂ </p>",
