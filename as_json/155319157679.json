   "quote-text" : "<p>The lengths I would go to hear her laugh &ndash; there were no limits. I loved her and loved making her laugh. She would do these crazy things and make me do these crazy things, but I really donât think they were crazy after all. In a way, it was a defense mechanism for her. She was so off the wall, she could use it as protection. Part of what was so poignant about her was that she was vulnerable, that there was this glimmer of a little girl that was so appealing and it roused the protective nature in my personality.</p>\n\n<p>Iâm grateful that we stayed friends and got to have this second act with the new movies. I think it was reassuring to her that I was there, the same person, that she could trust me, as critical as we could sometimes be with each other. We ran the gamut over the years, where we were in love with each other, where we hated each otherâs guts. âIâm not speaking to you, youâre such a judgmental, royal brat!â We went through it all. Itâs like we were a family.</p>\n\n<p>When you were in her good graces, you couldnât have more fun with any person on the planet. She was able to make you feel like you were the most important thing in her life. I think thatâs a really rare quality. And then you could go 180 degrees opposite, where you were furious with one another and wouldn&rsquo;t speak for weeks and weeks. But thatâs all part of what makes a relationship complete. Itâs not all one sided. Like I say, she was a handful. She was high maintenance. But my life would have been so much drabber and less interesting if she hadnât been the friend that she was.</p>",
