   "quote-text" : "<p>In an extract from his book, Crime, published in the Mail today, [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Ross\">Nick Ross</a>] reveals that he has been afflicted with a terrible case of visual agnosia which has left him unable to tell the difference between vaginas and laptops.</p>\n\n<p>He writes: &ldquo;We have come to acknowledge it is foolish to leave laptops on the back seat of a car [â¦] Our forebears might be astonished at how safe women are today given what throughout history would have been regarded as incitement [â¦] Equally they would be baffled that girls are mostly unescorted, stay out late, often get profoundly drunk and sometimes openly kiss, grope or go to bed with one-night stands.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, writing a manuscript in a state of perpetual confusion between portable computers and female genitals is a distressing condition â is that a return key or a clitoris? â and Ross is to be applauded for battling through to the end of his wordcount. And so, in a spirit of compassion for the baffled, I would like to offer Ross a brief guide to the ways in which women and their vaginas are not like cars and laptops.</p>",
