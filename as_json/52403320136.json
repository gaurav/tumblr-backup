the printing press was invented in 1450 and whilst it was revolutionary it wasnât very good. but then it got better over time and by the 16th century there were publications, novels, scientific journals, folios, pamphlets and newspapers all over Europe. at first most were educational or theological, or reprints of classical works.</p>\n<p>however, novels gained in popularity, as basically what most people wanted was to read for pleasure. they became salacious, extremely dramatic, with tragic heroines and doomed love and flawed heroes (see classical literature, only more extreme.) books in the form of letters were common. sensationalism was par the course and apparently used to teach moral lessons. there was also a <em>lot</em> of erotica floating around.Â </p>\n<p>but hereâs the thing: due to the greater availability of literature and the rise of comfy furniture (i shit you not this is an actual historical fact, the 16th and 17th century was when beds and chairs got comfy) people started reading novels for pleasure, women especially. as these novels were highly emotional, they too becameâ¦highly emotional. there are loads of contemporary reports of young women especially fainting, having hysterics, or crying fits lasting for days due to the death of a character or their otpâs doomed love. they became insensible over books and characters, and were very vocal about it. men werenât immune-thereâs a long letter a middle-aged man wrote to the author of his favourite work basically saying that the novel is too sad, he canât handle all his feels, if they donât get together he wonât be able to go on, and his heart is already broken at the heroineâs tragic state (IIRC ehh).Â </p>\n<p>conservatives at the time were seriously worried about the effects of literature on peopleâs mental health, and thought it damaging to both morals and society. so basically yes it is exactly like what happens on tumblr when we cry over attractive British men, only my historical theory (get me) is that their emotions were even more intense, as they hadnât had a life of sensationalist media to numb the pain for them beforehand in the same way we do, nor did they have the giant group therapy session that is tumblr.Â </p>\n<p>(donât even get me started on the classical/early medieval dudes and their boners for the Iliad i will be here all week. suffice to say, the members of the Byzantine court used Homeric puns instead of talking normally to each other if someone who handât studied the classics was in the room. they had dickish fandom in-jokes. boom.)Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I needed to know this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See, weâre all just the current steps in a time-honored tradition! (And this post is good to read along with Affectinglyâs <a href=\"http://affectingly.tumblr.com/post/42590141024\">post this week</a> about old-school-fandom-and-history-and-stuff.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ancient Iliad fandom is <em>intense</em></p>\n<p>Alexander the Great and and his boyfriend totally RPed Achilles and Patroclus. Alexander shipped that <em>hard</em>. (Itâs possible that this story is apocryphal, but that would just mean that ancient historians were writing RPS about Alexander and Hephaestion RPing Iliad slash and honestly thatâs just as good).</p>\n<p>And then thereâs this gem from Plato:</p>\n<p>âVery different was the reward of the true love of Achilles towards his lover Patroclus - his lover and not his love (the notion that Patroclus was the beloved one is a foolish error into which Aeschylus has fallen, for Achilles was surely the fairer of the two, fairer also than all the other heroes; and, as Homer informs us, he was still beardless, and younger far)â - Symposium</p>\n<p>Thatâs right: 4th Century BCE arguments about who topped. Nihil novi sub sole my friends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that the printing press in China is invented much earlier and it has basically the same effect. Social conservatives in the censor bureau censored huge amounts of literature and poetry because of the devastating effect it had on the literati class (who formed most of the government bureaucracy, letâs not forget: So your state governor canât work this week because heâs having Baoyu / Daiyu feels.) This did not stop it from leaking out anyway, in secret editions and hand-copied versions. And OMG the feels that these people have. Thereâs basically a constant struggle between the censors and this underground fandom, most novels are copied chapter-by-chapter, with people inserting fanfic chapters when they donât have all the material (so if you have chapters 2, 3, 4, 10, 12 of your favorite book you might write your own 5-9 and circulate them) or just writing straight-up fanfic (famously in Water Margin and Red Chamber it _becomes canon_ after the authorâs death.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This post is the best thing, every part of it. Nothing to add except wow.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Iâve reblogged this before, but it had less information on it then. Â  Shakespeare is almost entirely stuff weâd call fanfiction nowadays and his histories are RPF. We have evidence medieval nobility did things a lot like weekend-long LARP as entertainment, with paid performers as game organizers and NPCs. Â For centuries, there have been rumors that Queen Victoria knighted Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in order to pressure him into retconning Reichenbach and continuing to write Sherlock Holmes stories. Â </p>\n<p>I was an enormous Tolkien geek in middle school, and went as far as reading a lot of his letters/a lot of Simarillion meta. Â The short version is, he deliberately left gaps in the Silmarillion because Tolkien, as a professor of language and mythology, believed that <strong><em>for nearly all of human history storytelling had been participatory and involved many tellers of the same tales.</em></strong> Â He thought early-to-mid 20th century pop-culture and mass media were destructive because people did far less telling of stories, claiming of stories, and reworking of stories. Â I am pretty sure that, despite being a stuffy old professorial Christian white dude who would probably not read any porny fic or watch shippy vids, Tolkien is beaming in his grave over such thingsâ existence - over participatory storytelling having finally made its glorious comeback, over the 20th centuryâs approach to narrative being firmly established as an abberant nightmare that is thankfully mostly over. Did we get mythos we all reference and participate in to come back in style? Â Oh, by Harry Potterâs scar and every Jediâs lightsaber, have we ever pulled that one off.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have an intense urge to re-read The Satyricon now.</p>\n</blockquote>",
