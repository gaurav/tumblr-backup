Imagine how impossible it would be to not go take a look if the circle of ants started chanting your name.<br/><br/>And theyâre like, you canât leave because we drew a line made of tiny crystals - now you have to do us a favor.<br/><br/>And youâre like, letâs just see where this goesÂ âyup, you got meâ¦ whatâs the favor?â<br/><br/>and usually the favor is like,Â âkill this one ant for usâ orÂ âgive me a pile of sugarâ and youâre likeâ¦ okay? and you do, because why not, it isnât hard for you and boy is this going to be a fucking story to tell, these fucking ants chanting your name and wanting a spoonful of sugar or whatever.<br/><br/>And SOMEtimes you get asked for things you canât really do, one of them, sheâs like, âI love this ant but she wonât pay any attention to me, make me important to herâ and youâre likeâ¦ um? how? So you just kill every ant in the colony except the two of them, ta-da! problem solved! and the first ant is like *horrified whisper*Â âwhat have I doneâ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>for some reason my brain wonât let go of this one, soâ¦.<br/><br/>Meanwhile another colony of ants invades your house, and evidently that last ant has gotten some of them to join her in a circle and taught them the ritual because youâre coming out of the bathroom one day and you hear the ants singing your name. Sure enough itâs that ant, but sheâs dark and fucked up now, and sheâs like,Â âkill the queen. I will rule this colonyâ and youâre like, sure, I guess I kinda owe her, and you do it. And she manages to become queen, and they worship you. Which is cool, youâre not, you know, very important in the human world, but to these ants youâre practically all-powerful. You canât be just, doing everything a bunch of ants tell you to, though, when would you watch netflx? So you tend to only show up for super important ants; you teach them some extra words and when hear them you go see whatâs up. Usually. Also just to your name, if youâre bored. And, sometimes some of the ants are like, tell us more human names, and youâre kind of jealous of the idea of some other human diluting your private godhood, so you refuse. <br/><br/>Your roommate Greg is like, yo, thatâs fucking awesome, I want ant worshipers! But whenever he approaches any, they run away, because it turns out that the illusion of control from the named summoning is what makes them feel safe around you. Thatâs great, because Greg is a dick who never does the dishes, and one day you decide to teach Greg a lesson.<br/><br/>So you show up at the colony, and youâre like, âyo, witch queen, did you think there would be no price for all these things? Your colony must do something for me, go to the Room of the Housemate, I will meet you there.â And you go sit on the couch and play Overwatch for a while. Youâre like, right there, you can clearly see the ants all marching along the wall to Gregâs room, but to them youâre not even there, youâre so far away they canât see you. It takes them, like, an ant week to make the journey. They have to figure out ways to get over and around things. Some of them drown, or get stepped on by the dog, or whatever. You win a game, you lose a game, you look over, and theyâre trying to get through some cobwebsâ¦ looks like theyâre mostly going to live, you keep playing, you look over, okay theyâre all in there, and you stand up and walk over and by the time theyâve chanted your name once, youâre there.Â âright, hold onâ and you look around and you see a twelve-pack of Gregâs precious fucking soda, that he keeps in his room and refuses to ever share, even though itâs a communal food household and you share your hot chocolate with him all the time. So you gather the ants unto you, and you poke a little hole in each of the sodas and you leave the room to the sound of the ants rejoicing. Greg will suspect of course, but heâll never be able to prove the ants didnât chew holes in the plastic and steal his stupid drinks.Â <br/><br/>But later, while youâre at work, Greg destroys most of the colony in a rage, and you come home to find the witch queen gasping her lastÂ âthe Dew of the Mountain, which you had us steal, was cursed - and so I lay my curse on youâ and then she dies.<br/><br/>Well first of all, you donât really believe in curses, but last month you didnât believe ants could know your name, so thatâs unsettling. And second of all, you feel kind of bad. You know, not SUPER bad, cause sheâs like, an ant. But still. And most importantly, third of all, Greg must pay.<br/><br/>But Greg has done more than kill a bunch of the colony. As you wait for eggs and pupae to replenish the ant population, you discover he has found some ants that didnât go on the Mountain Dew raid, and heâs spared them, told them his name, and made himself a good sized cult in YOUR fucking ant queendom.<br/><br/>Greg has started locking his door. So now you NEED the ants. Once again you direct the ants loyal to you to journey to Gregâs room. You meet them at the door. A locked door means nothing to the ants, they donât even know there is a door, and can barely perceive the difference between it being open and shut - either passing the threshold on the floor regardless, or being on its surface no matter the position. But you need them to get inside. Youâre going to put itching powder in his underwear drawer and leave a raw fish under his bed. So you instruct the leading party of ants how to go into the Cave of Keyhole, and position the Magic Megaliths inside just right to enable the opening of the Great Door and allow you to pass into the Realm of Housemate.<br/><br/>Crouched by the door, you can hear when your ants are met by a party of Greg Cultists, who insist that if the Great Door is opened, the colony will be doomed. There is fighting. Your ants prevail, the lock tumblers are moved into place, and you swing the door openâ¦<br/><br/>To find Greg! In his room all along! Itâs a trap! His cultists attack you! I mean, they canât do much real harm, but it kind of hurts and itâs super annoying. You order your ants to attack him, and they do, but he storms over and pours bleach down the colony entrance.<br/><br/>Now you and Greg are at war, and you both understand the unspoken rules to your fight. You canât do things directly to each other, why, that would be assault. But anything you can get your ants to do is fine, becauseÂ âshe told the ants to do it to meâ isnât going to get very far with any authority figures that get involved.Â <br/><br/>Later, nursing your anger, you confer with your few remaining ants and stare moodily at your new prize, the ant farm that came in the mail. Bullet ants donât usually get along with sugar ants, but youâre betting they will if a god tells them to. Meanwhile, youâve got a laptop schematic to go over with your high priestess. Itâs finals week, and if you time it right, heâll lose everythingâ¦</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Feel free to add your own stories paralleling human/otherworldly with insect/human interactions!<br/><br/>Iâm going to have this repost a few times because I want to see which of my mutuals are into this kind of thing because Iâm preparing to test drive a fiction share and writing prompt project</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Idea of the old gods obeying us not because of supernatural reason, but because they think itâs funny to watch the tiny animals fight IS the answer to everything</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mz8u4SGqeMAjntZjjaAQUMg\">@zuzu-and-friends</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mh8QdRy7P3t-n_P_yEfYatg\">@bogleech</a>, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIDfwOivYnLcwSPbzC7XKTw\">@tyrantisterror</a><br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âHuman baffled at a bunch of ants inexplicably calling it by nameâ is a better characterization for an eldritch abomination than 99% of eldritch abominations in fiction.<br/></p></blockquote>",
