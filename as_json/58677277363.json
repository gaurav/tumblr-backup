   "quote-text" : "The first thing that needs to be said historically about Jim Crow voting laws is that they have never been (to my knowledge) <em>explicitly</em> racist. Even at the height of segregation, no law ever said that black people could not vote <em>for being black</em>. Jim Crow has always been about finding âjustifiableâ means (albeit fantastically ludicrous and farcical ones) of rigging the voting pool to the advantage of the party in power. In the segregated south, these means included poll taxes (since it costs money to count votes) and civics and literacy tests (since a democracy requires educated citizens). These laws were then enforced selectively so that poor whites did not get tripped up by them. In our present sociopolitical environment, it is no longer possible to systematically disenfranchise an entire race at the level that could be accomplished in the Old South. But what the new voting laws can accomplish is to suppress enough of a percentage of voters to tip the balance in a close election.",
