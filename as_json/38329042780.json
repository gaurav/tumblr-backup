   "quote-text" : "<p>Statement: This is your opportunity to shine. This should be a relatively short (under 2000 word give or take) statement that does the following. 1) Outline why you are interested in Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology (itâs our department name, hit on at least one of those topics as your main interest). 2) Give us some insight into how your undergrad experience has prepared you for grad school, but for the love of god do not go into a long litany of your research experience, that information is on your CV. 3) Where you think your given subfield is going and 4) How you think your research will help address these developments.</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n\n<p>I was looking for students who had good experience and above all who were articulate about their passion.  I will be working with these students for five to seven years in the department and I wanted people who would be excited about being there and who would do the best with the opportunities provided them. I liked students who asked big interesting questions and who had clearly done their homework. In the end most students did not tell a convincing narrative about where they wanted to go, and why coming here was the next logical step in a clearly defined path.  That isnât to say that those who didnât make the cut were not great scholars, good people, or folks worthy of getting into this program. Quite often they were but there was either a problem of fit (wanting to do something that we donât offer) or it was clear that their plans were still unformed.  There is nothing wrong with taking a couple of years off and figuring out if a Ph.D. is really what you need to do to get where you want to go.</p>",
