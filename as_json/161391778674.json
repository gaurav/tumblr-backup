   "link-description" : "<p><a href=\"http://thebrainscoop.tumblr.com/post/161388424166/us-geological-survey\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">thebrainscoop</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>This is the U.S. Geological Surveyâs budget justification for 2018. The USGS is a scientific, research-based organization within the Department of the Interior. Meaning, should congress vote to pass Trumpâs <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/23/politics/trump-budget-cuts-programs/\">proposed budget</a>, these are the changes/eliminations/reductions that USGS would have to undertake.Â </p><p>This cut in particular caught my eye (pg. 52):Â </p><figure data-orig-width=\"1051\" data-orig-height=\"334\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bcf786ab5045224963384d32f299ca83/tumblr_inline_oqz1vvzuNa1r1uqvj_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1051\" data-orig-height=\"334\"/></figure><p>The Smithsonian is a federal agency that receives <a href=\"http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/facts-about-smithsonian-institution-short\">60% of its funding from congress, federal grants and contracts</a>. This is an instance where a portion of the funding for the curatorial research positions at the Smithsonian that are supported by the USGS would be eliminated. Not the entire curatorial or collections staff - that would be â¦ insanity. But 11 full time employees (FTE) and $1.6million would be cut from the Smithsonianâs operating budget.<br/></p><p>Take a look at the rest of the report. The budget request includes a 16% reduction of the USGS workforce. USGS currently employees 4,923 full time employees. This would be a reduction of more than 800 people - and, again, these are primarily scientific research positions. The federal government employs a <i>lot</i>Â of scientists (or, traditionally has in.. recent years).Â </p><figure data-orig-width=\"626\" data-orig-height=\"137\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/361320c6ba8bae0625405a709a2f53a1/tumblr_inline_oqz2n2NRhh1r1uqvj_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"626\" data-orig-height=\"137\"/></figure><p>Pg. 54.Â </p><figure data-orig-width=\"620\" data-orig-height=\"178\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2034b7bc147ffeb33a1b9bed30595b0e/tumblr_inline_oqz2qkIGuA1r1uqvj_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"620\" data-orig-height=\"178\"/></figure><p>pg. 57.Â </p><p>I could go through the rest of the report but if you want to get a sense of which programs are being cut, just ctrl + F âeliminateâ and scroll on through.Â </p><p>Whatâs so disappointing to me is that the United States has been at the forefront for so many research areas in recent decades. We built an infrastructure that supported not just innovation in a variety of fields, but a system which allowed for long-term monitoring of our planet. Big, comprehensive datasets are invaluable for our understanding of change over time - how we come to know what a place used to be, or look like, and how thatâs different from today. This information helps us mitigate problems and anticipate change.Â </p><p>With the sudden halt of many of these programs, we would be creating gaps in our knowledge base. Like little moments of amnesia, our countryâs scientists would be deprived of information which could further progress. And this goes well beyond our borders: the research conducted by USGS and other federal agencies benefits our global partners, our worldâs citizens, and future science.</p><p>This is a tough road for so many young scientists here in the states; weâre going from a STEM-centric system that advocated for increasing scientific involvement and literacy in our country, to swiftly dumping them in a world where we have eliminated their jobs and have quickly undervalued their credentials. And thatâs frightening because the world is not going to stop and wait for us to catch up - the changes happening around our planet necessitate immediate action. At a time when we need science and science literacy more than ever, opportunities for both are decreasing.</p><p>Iâm not proposing any sort of solution (I donât have one) nor do I mean for this to feel like Dooms Day is upon us - but we have to keep paying attention, to stay engaged, and to continue dialogue. I donât think itâs an overreach to say that our future depends upon our sustained engagement with the problems that face us today.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This is why biodiversity informatics is so damn important: not (just) because so many lineages are going extinct, but because comprehensive catalogues of preserved specimens may soon be the only way to find something in some of the greatest collections of biological artifacts ever assembled.</p>",
