   "quote-source" : "Democracy in America, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/01/ambling-civility\"><em>Vast crowds gather to protest Donald Trump</em></a>, The Economist, January 21, 2017",
   "quote-text" : "<p>In that respect, the march was partly about making the side that lost in November feel better. Thatâs understandable, but there is also a danger for those who oppose the president from the left here. Politics has become so much about signalling what sort of person you are that the hard work of persuading people who disagree gets forgotten. Yesterday the city was filled with ardent Trump supporters. Yet rather than try to win converts, the two sides mostly ignored each other, politely. Waving a Planned Parenthood banner in a crowd of people who are pro-choice is a political act, but it is a minor one compared with talking to someone who voted for a candidate you despise and trying to find some common ground. Those who oppose the president need to spend more time thinking about how to win over people who voted for Mr Trump and less time talking to each other.</p>\n\n<p>While all this was going on, the president visited the CIA at Langley, Virginia where, before a memorial for agents who died in the countryâs service, he gave a political speech in which he attacked the press. His spokesman, Sean Spicer, then used a first White House briefing to attack the press for allegedly giving the impression that the crowds on inauguration day were smaller than they were. Presidents and their administrations are not supposed to conduct themselves like this, which is of course what many people like about Mr Trump. Those marchers standing up for civility, politeness and decorumâold-fashioned conservative valuesâwill find the next four years hard going.</p>",
