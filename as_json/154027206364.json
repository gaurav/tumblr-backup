   "quote-source" : "Lexington, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2016/12/us-china-relations\"><em>How to read Donald Trumpâs call with Taiwanâs president</em></a>, The Economist, December 4, 2016",
   "quote-text" : "<p>So are Trump-backers correct in calling this outreach to Ms Tsai a deft move? I have visited Taiwan many times and am deeply fond of the place, but I suspect that Mr Trump and his team are almost certainly setting Taiwan up for a fall. That is because there is no chance that, if forced to choose between peaceful relations with China and friendship with Taiwan, any American president will choose Taiwan. And make no mistake, China would force President Trump to choose. At which point he would drop Taiwan like a hot steamed bun.</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n\n<p>âThe fact that a simple courtesy call caused so much trepidation and genuflections to past protocol just shows how absurd U.S.-China policy has become,â wroteÂ Mr [Stephen] Yates. âIf a little courtesy to a democratic friend and a little truth about Taiwan could really threaten peace in the Pacific, as the experts contend, then we need to reevaluate our defense and come up with something better.â</p>\n\n<p>That sounds alarmingly like someone contemplating how America might back up a change in its China policy with military force. Is this what Mr Trump has in mind? Almost certainly not. Is it true that Mr Trump has been taking advice from Mr Yates and some other advocates of confrontation with China (John Bolton, the former ambassador to the UN, has also been named in press reports). Nobody knows, because his transition is a black box. Unlike all modern presidents-elect he has largely shunned the structures of government. He has made phone calls to foreign leaders from his office in Manhattan and some cases via mobile telephone, relying on foreign government interpreters and note-takers, rather than on the well-oiled machinery of the State Department. It is hard to know who his foreign policy advisers areâmany are named as offering him counsel, but in interviews some of those sages admit that they have barely met him.</p>",
