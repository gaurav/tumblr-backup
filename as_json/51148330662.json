   "regular-body" : "<p>So I think about three minutes in dreamtime just overturned one of my most cherished personal rules.</p>\n\n<p>Reply: yes! definitely ^_^. To be fair, it&rsquo;s not a big personal rule: the last three minutes of my dream explored what happens when you like someone who likes someone else; how do you navigate the situation that it&rsquo;s probably not a good idea to hang out with someone who&rsquo;s probably going to want to talk to you about this other guy who you wish you could be. I have this really complicated personal rule, a part of which says that the best move is probably to level with them, so they know the circs and why you&rsquo;re suddenly being weird around them. I hate it when people are all &ldquo;no no I won&rsquo;t tell them I like them, it&rsquo;s for their own good&rdquo;, because I think it needlessly dismisses the other person; but it&rsquo;s also a hard position to put someone into? But I did it once and it was mostly okay? The good news is that I&rsquo;m a lot savvier about people I like and friends and managing my relationships with human beings better than I was a decade ago, so hopefully this situation are far less likely than it once was.</p>",
