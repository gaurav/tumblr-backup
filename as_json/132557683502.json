And no girls. â¦ Who would be capable of creating a romantic, delicately drawn, non-Freudian and non-juvenile, picture for LOLITA (a dissolving remoteness, a soft American landscape, a nostalgic highwayâthat sort of thing)? <b>There is one subject which I am emphatically opposed to: any kind of representation of a little girl.</b>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and yet, the representations of the sexy little girl abound.</p>\n<p>i became driven by curiousity. why did this happen? why is this happening?</p>\n<p>i am not alone âÂ <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1440329869/braipick-20\">thereâs a book about this</a>, with several essays and artistsâ conceptions about the politics and problems of representation surrounding the covers of âlolita.âÂ <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/designing-lolita\">this new yorker article</a> gives a summary of the book and its ideas, and interviews one of the editors:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Many of the covers guilty of misrepresenting Lolita as a teen seductress feature images from Hollywood movie adaptations of the bookâ Kubrickâs 1962 version, starring Sue Lyon, and Adrian Lyneâs 1997 one. Are those films primarily to blame for the sexualization of Lolita?<br/></i><br/>As is argued in several of the bookâs essays, the promotional image of Sue Lyon in the heart-shaped sunglasses, taken by photographer Bert Stern, is easily the most significant culprit in this regard, much more so than the Kubrick film itself (significantly, neither the sunglasses nor the lollipop ever appears in the film), or the later film by Adrian Lyne. Once this image became associated with âLolitaââand itâs important to remember that, in the film, Lolita is sixteen years old, not twelveâit really didnât matter that it was a terribly inaccurate portrait. It became <i>the</i> image of Lolita, and it was ubiquitous. There are other factors that have contributed to the incorrect reading, from the bookâs initial publication in Olympia Pressâs Travellerâs Series (essentially, a collection of dirty books), to Kubrickâs startlingly unfaithful adaptation. At the heart of all of this seems to be the desire to make the sexual aspect of the novel more palatable.<br/></blockquote>\n<p>hereâs a couple of kubrick inspired covers:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6f796ae9fb6292be19b5b2bca0860100/tumblr_inline_nl2fsb2PPZ1qa8cig.png\" alt=\"image\"/></figure><p>which very well could have, after tremendous sales, have influenced the following covers:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b04f2ae9e13f5498139f02dad82d08e/tumblr_inline_nl2ftox5Zv1qa8cig.png\" alt=\"image\"/></figure><p>â¦straying so far from the intention of nabokov that the phenomenon begins to look more like the symptom of something larger, something sicker.</p>\n<p>after a lot of researching covers, it was <a href=\"http://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/09/lolita-the-story-of-a-cover-girl/\">here</a>, in this sampling of concept covers for the book about the lolita covers, that i found an image that best represents the story to me:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a1acd636fcd05d7650905c8827c970d/tumblr_inline_nl26mkJ6nK1qa8cig.jpg\" alt=\"image\"/></figure><p>[art by linn olofsdotter â and again, this is not an official cover]</p>\n<p>but why arenât all the covers like that? even the ones published byÂ âlegitimateâ publishing companies, with full academic credentials, with no intended connection to the film; surely they must have read nabokovâs instructions for the cover. and yet, look at the top row of lolita covers: all legitimate publishing companies, not prone to smut. and yet.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6fbf23bebdc9104d137eb50e182ae021/tumblr_inline_nl2fz0GLjN1qa8cig.jpg\" alt=\"image\"/></figure><p>my conclusion is that the lolita complex existed beforeÂ âlolitaâ (and of course it did) â a patriarchal society is essentially operating with the same delusions of humbert humbert. nabokov did not produce the sexy girl covers of lolita, and kubrick had only the smallest hand in it. it was what people <b>desired</b>, <b>requested</b> and <b>bought</b>. the image of the sexy girl sells; intrigues; gets the hands on the books.</p>\n<p>as elizabeth janeway said in her review in <i>the new york review of books</i>: âHumbert is every man who is driven by desire, wanting his Lolita so badly that it never occurs to him to consider her as a human being, or as anything but a dream-figment made flesh.â<br/></p>\n<p>isnât that our media as a whole? our culture as a whole?</p>\n<p>the whole lot of them/us â seeing the world through humbert-tinted glasses, seeing all others as Other and Object, as solipsistic dream-reality. as i scroll through theÂ âlolitaâ covers i wonder: whereâs the humanity in our humanity?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>pretty interesting read here</p></blockquote>",
