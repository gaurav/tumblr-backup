   "quote-text" : "<p>That points to another reason to fear Mr Trumpâs populist victory. For populism involves more than policies that are at once simple and stirring enough to shout at a rally (âBuild That Wallâ) or print on a bumper sticker. Populism is also the politics of Them and Us, involving appeals to tribal identities, and zero-sum contests over hard-pressed resources. Populism is hardly new. What makes Mr Trumpâs win different is that he so explicitly sought to cast his opponents as illegitimate, unfit, contemptible, un-American or (a favourite word) âdisgustingââand was confident that he would find an echo among his voters.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Trump was the nominee of a party which, after losing the presidential election of 2012, commissioned a post-mortem that concluded that until Republicans built a new coalition, including many more non-whites and other fast-growing demographic blocs, it would struggle to win national office again. Mr Trumpâs gamble was to take an exactly opposite approach. He bet everything on a strategy of nostalgic nationalism, summed up in the slogan âMake America Great Againâ, precisely because his hunch was that the country is home to an underestimated mass of voters who do not want to be part of any rainbow coalition, thank youâand certainly not if the price is granting amnesty to immigrants in the country without the right papers, or embracing gay marriage.</p>",
