So it goes with Hollywoodâs consistent inability to include actors of color.</p>\n<p>Popular critical consensus suggests that we may have as many as four black Best Actor nominees: Chiwetel Ejiofor (â12 Years a Slaveâ), Idris Elba (âMandela: Long Walk to Freedomâ), Forest Whitaker (âLee Danielsâ The Butlerâ) and Michael B. Jordan (âFruitvale Stationâ). Ejiofor is currently favored to win the category, where heâll probably be joined by the likes of Tom Hanks (âCaptain Phillipsâ), Robert Redford (âAll Is Lostâ) and Bruce Dern (âNebraskaâ).</p>\n<p>That these men of color are even being discussed in awards blogger circles is certainly cause for celebration, because each of their films presents a perspective that doesnât get much play in Hollywood. But insofar as these four movies are important, they are also limited by their veracity. Theyâre all based on true stories: â12 Yearsâ tells the tale of Solomon Northup, a free black man who was captured and enslaved and wrote an autobiography by the same name; âMandelaâ is self-explanatory; âFruitvale Stationâ centers on the 2009 shooting death of Oscar Grant III, a black man shot dead by a police officer in Oakland; âThe Butlerâ draws its meat from the life of Eugene Allen, a black butler who worked for the White House for over three decades.</p>\n<p>Put another way, these roles <em>have to</em> be played by black actors. Each of these men has more than earned the nominations theyâre expected to receive (nowâs a good time to pinch in some salt: awards bloggers love to shower performances with praise, but nominations are certainly not guaranteed), but the fact that theyâre generally only rewarded for roles that literally could not have been given to white actors is cause for concern.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Generally only rewarded for roles that literally could not have been given to white actors&rdquo; is not casual phrasing. A study of the roles that have earned black men Best Actor nominations reveals that this is a historical problem. Sidney Poitier won in 1963 for playing a black itinerant worker in &ldquo;Lilies of the Field,&rdquo; a movie based on a novel by the same name. Jamie Foxx won in 2004 for playing Ray Charles in &ldquo;Ray,&rdquo; and Forest Whitaker won in 2006 for playing Idi Amin in &ldquo;The Last King of Scotland.&rdquo; The only black man to win Best Actor for a role that <em>could</em> have been played by a white actor is Denzel Washington, who won in 2001 for his turn as a LAPD detective in âTraining Day.â</p>\n<p>Thatâs one man over 85 years of Academy Awards. The situation isnât much better at the Golden Globes, where Morgan Freemanâs performance as a chauffeur who triumphs over racism in âDriving Miss Daisyâ joins the otherwise identical list of Best Actor winners. (Nor, itâs worth noting, does the picture improve when including Best Actor <em>nominees</em> at the Oscars, a class that includes blacks playing âblack rolesâ such as Will Smith in âAli,â Don Cheadle in âHotel Rwanda,â Terrence Howard in âHustle &amp; Flow,â Freeman in âInvictus,â Washington in âMalcom X,â Laurence Fishburne in âWhatâs Love Got to Do With It,â etc.)</p>\n<p>Jordan has discussed enjoying filming âChronicle,â which he <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/michael-b-jordan-fruitvale-station_n_3570502.html\" target=\"_hplink\">describes as a win because the character was originally supposed to be a white Jewish man</a>. â[With] the lack thereof of quality roles for African-American actors, I look for stuff like that,â he said in an interview with HuffPost Entertainment. âI want the script that Ben Affleck or Leonardo DiCaprio couldnât do because of scheduling. I want that one. I want those types of roles.â</p>\n<p>Hollywood is even worse at including women of color in award-winning performances, (Halle Berry is the <em>only</em> black woman to ever win the Oscar for Best Actress, in a âMonsterâs Ballâ role with a complex and controversial relationship with race), and this yearâs Emmys <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/diversity-gap-emmys_n_3998242.html\" target=\"_hplink\">were a shockingly white-male affair</a>. â12 Years,â âThe Butler,â âFruitvaleâ and âMandelaâ all cleared an extra hurdle: they are are all independently financed films that were created without the interest or fiscal support of the major movie studios.</p>\n<p>True equality in the Best Actor race doesnât mean only rewarding black men in roles white men could never play. Instead, weâll know when Hollywood casting directors and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences view people of color as deserving of equal opportunities to shine when a black man in the role of a fictional caring father, son, teacher, student, doctor, author or otherwise non-racially coded character is nominated for and wins Best Actor.</p>\n<div>Until then, however, letâs raise a glass to this yearâs class of outstanding performers, because maybe, just maybe their success in this yearâs awards rat race will jostle the shamefully whitewashed powers that be within the industry. Forgive me for not getting my hopes up</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>real talk.</p>\n</blockquote>",
