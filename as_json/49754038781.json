Finlay quote: âA novel doesnât excite readers because you took all the bad stuff out of it, it excites them because of all the good stuff thatâs in it, regardless of the bad.â</p>\n<p>(via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://malindalo.tumblr.com/\">malindalo</a>)</p>\n<p>â¦.</p>\n<p>YES, THIS. LETâS TALK ABOUT <em>TWILIGHT</em>!</p>\n<p>(via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://rainbowrowell.tumblr.com/\">rainbowrowell</a>)</p>\n<p>Reblogging because I think the principle applies to illustration as wellâ¦ or probably anything else that causes creative envy. Much better to look at something and ask âwhat are they doing right thatâs getting them this success?â than belittle something because the success didnât come to you.Â </p>\n<p>Also within professional circles, always always always be respectful about critiquing, because sheesh, who knows whoâs listening to you.</p> (via <a href=\"http://siminib.tumblr.com/\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">siminib</a>)",
   "quote-text" : "<p>At a workshop not too many years ago a newer writer began to condemn a best selling novel, pointing out all its flaws and jagged edges. I listened for a long time, nodding.</p>\n\n<p>âAll those things are true,â I said. And gave him the C.C. Finlay quote. âBut until you learn what the good parts were that excited the reader, youâre always going to be bitterly upset about what is wrong with that bestseller. Learn to spot what worked in that book, and youâll be able to move forward. And youâll be a lot less upset all the time as well.â</p>",
