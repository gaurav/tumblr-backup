   "answer" : "<p>How innocently people are awful at communication. I know the word âinnocentâ sounds out of place here, so let me explain what I mean. <br/></p><p>(Iâm going to use the example of a male patient, but it happens with both sexes.)</p><p>He will say âMy wife keeps getting mad at me for no reason, I donât know what to doâ. I ask him for details. He says something like âI ask her when dinner will be ready and she just flips out at meâ. <br/></p><p>I suggest that we roleplay the conversation; Iâll pretend to be his wife, and heâll talk to me the way he usually talks to her. It will go something like this:</p><p>ME: (in falsetto voice) Hi honey, welcome home!</p><p>HIM: Why isnât dinner ready yet? Whatâs wrong with you? All I want is to have dinner ready when I get home, and you can never do it!</p><p>ME (no longer in falsetto voice, speaking normally): Wait, are you exaggerating this or is that how you normally talk to your wife?</p><p>HIM: Thatâs how I normally talk to my wife.</p><p>ME: And just to be clear, youâre confused why she gets angry when you talk to her that way, and youâre asking me to figure out this mystery, right?</p><p>HIM: Yes.</p><p>ME: And you didnât exaggerate that at all, thatâs definitely how you usually talk?</p><p>HIM: Yes.</p><p>ME: When I was pretending to be your wife, I felt attacked by the way you asked me if dinner was ready.</p><p>HIM: Why?</p><p>ME: Well, I wrote down what you said on my notepad here, and it was âWhy isnât dinner ready yet? Whatâs wrong with you? All I want is to have dinner ready when I get home, and you can never do it!â Do you think you could have asked this more like âHi honey, when will dinner be ready?â</p><p>HIM: Iâm afraid she wouldnât take me seriously if I did that. She might just say something like âItâll be ready laterâ, and then she wouldnât know that Iâm really hungry and really upset that she didnât make it already.</p><p>ME: It sounds like dinner being ready on time is very important to you. Is there any way you can talk to your wife at some other point, like when youâre out on a date, let her know how important that is to you, and ask her if the two of you can come up with some system? Like maybe on days when she has lots of time, she can make dinner for you, and on days when sheâs busy, she can let you know she wonât be making dinner and then you can bring some food home?</p><p>HIM: <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1107\" data-orig-height=\"395\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/78a13208d3d6beec9c3bf407a5a9eae0/tumblr_inline_powvoiHMPg1skdjyu_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1107\" data-orig-height=\"395\"/></figure><p>Itâs really surprising to me not just how many people are terrible communicators, but how many people, when asked to simulate their communication style in front of a psychiatrist, will be so innocent about how bad a communicator they are that they wonât try to hide it, they wonât try to change their answers in order to look better, theyâll just say things that are totally awful and offensive and then in all honesty ask me why I think their partner gets angry.</p><p>I assume thereâs some cultural difference here, and maybe Iâm the person whoâs in the wrong in some subtle hard-to-understand way, but usually they tell me their wife miraculously stopped being temperamental and incomprehensible around the time they worked out some alternative dinner-assurance system besides yelling at her.</p><p>I guess this is another thing that surprises me, is how un-systematic some people are. By the fiftieth time I yelled at my wife for not making dinner on time, I would be considering the hypothesis that thereâs a better way to solve this than more yelling, but a lot of people canât seem to figure that out. </p><p>Eliezer had a phrase I like, âtechnical solutions to human problemsâ, of which the classic example is that if you donât like your partner making noise, instead of yelling at her, you get earplugs (I realize earplugs donât always work well in real life, itâs just an example). Iâve heard some people debate whether this is really a good idea or not. But it seems like some of my patients are the total opposite end of the scale, so fixated on human solutions to human problems that they canât imagine addressing any of their issues other than by yelling at the other person to change even louder than they were yelling before.</p>",
