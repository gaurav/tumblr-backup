   "quote-text" : "<p>According to Sullivan, whom I spoke with recently, his interrogation of Amy came to an âabrupt haltâ when Judy Bishop entered the booking room, in a conspicuous breach of protocol. One of the captains on duty told him that Judy Bishop had spoken to Polio and explained that the shooting had been an accidentâand Polio believed her.</p>\n\n<p>âI was like, <em>What?</em>â Sullivan told me. He recalled complaining to the captain, âIf we let every person go because their mother didnât think they committed a crime, there would be no point in arresting anyone.â But he was told that Polio had ordered the release, and that he was âto obey that order.â</p>",
