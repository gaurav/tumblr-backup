You see, Iâm prone to\nprocrastination. So now that Iâm trying to take writing more seriously (so that\nI can finally finish writing a first draft), Iâm suspicious of myself in this\nspecific situation.</b></p><p>Dear\nNiminonono,</p><p>You\nhave asked one of <i>The</i> Writing\nQuestions! Letâs take a moment to CELEBRATE.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"264\" data-orig-height=\"178\"><img src=\"http://78.media.tumblr.com/1e1e68bcee7125188ed0603dc6243aa1/tumblr_inline_nnbhgi9woY1r0pfzu_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"264\" data-orig-height=\"178\"/></figure><p>Your\nquestion is a branch on the tree of this question: <b><i>is a reading a form of\nprocrastination that prevents you from writing?</i></b> You canât write without\nreading. You have to do it. But you have correctly pointed out that at a\ncertain point you need to stop reading and write.</p><p>This\nis why people go into RESEARCH SPIRALS where they research so much that they\nnever actually write the thing they need to write. The questions beat in the\nmind constantlyâ<i>am I done? Am I ready? Do\nI know enough?</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"328\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://78.media.tumblr.com/9f33e0483389fbee7d3b6627be6a6395/tumblr_inline_nnbht1clh91r0pfzu_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"328\"/></figure><p><i><b>Do I know enough???Â </b></i></p><p>But\nyou are asking specifically about reading books about writing. And I have an\nanswer for you.</p><p>Â Yes.</p><p>Â Yes,\nreading books about writing can be a form of procrastination that prevents you\nfrom writing.</p><p>Â Now\nlet me break it down.</p><p><b>1.\nYou donât need to read any books on writing to learn how to writeâbecause all\nbooks are books about how to write.</b></p><p>I\njust blew your mind. I know. Deep. Also true. All books with words in them\nteach us about writing. We learn by taking in the various components of whatâs\non the page (or screen). From the big things (story, overall structure, book\nlength) to the page level (paragraph length, sentence length and structure) to\nthe word choice level. We note repetition and themes. We take in the authorâs\nstyle. We decide whether or not we like it, and (often separately) whether or\nnot it is effective. We often do these things without realizing it. <i><b>Writing instruction is largely an exercise\nin getting you to notice and consciously choose to do things you are likely\nalready doing.</b></i></p><p>This\nis pretty key. Once you know to look for these things, you tend to look for\nthem more and keep a clearer mental register. You can also drive yourself\ninsane looking for them and wind up spending twenty years analyzing a single\nparagraph, and you will end up looking like this:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"375\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://78.media.tumblr.com/2cb8afb920d6e8c370ff573d45b81f28/tumblr_inline_nnbi7bYb811r0pfzu_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"375\"/></figure><p>At\na certain point, you need to let go and write. So sure, books on writing are\nfine. But in the end, they are sort of like everything else we read. They can\nhave good tips, for sure. But letâs move on to point twoâ¦<br/></p><p><b>2.\nIf you are going to read books on writing, read more than one, but maybe not\nmore than ten.</b></p><p>This\nis just a personal tip from me. I donât know how many you have read. Iâm\nguessing that if you are writing this question thatâs itâs probably a few. I\nthink ten is about the limit. Hereâs why.</p><p>Everyone\nhas a different way of writing and a different style of explaining how they\nwrite, if they explain at all. So if you only read one book on writing, you may\nget the idea that youâve done itâyouâve read A Book by someone who published A\nBook.</p><p>Anyone\ncan publish a book. Iâve published a bunch of books and the other day I drank\nsalad dressing instead of water. What does that tell you? Some books on writing\nwill be good, and some will be very generic, and some will be okay, and some\nwill be dumb. They vary, as all books do. So if you start down the path, read a\ncouple. Try to mix it up a bit.</p><p>Some\nbooks are all about structureâstory arc, character archetypes, conflict,\nresolution, etc. These are good things to know about. If youâre going down the\nwriting book route, read a few books like this.</p><p>Some\nbooks are more about the muse and the feeling and the magical journey and the\nbirds singing in your ear. They might have a lot of very fluid exercises in\nthem, like making lists of things you see, or writing a hundred words about a\npiece of grassâthat sort of thing. These books have their place. I have a few\nof these I like.</p><p>And\nthen there are the books by the people who write for a living who will\nbasically just tell you to write. Just write. Start now and work hard and write\nevery day. Thatâs good advice. Thatâs how it actually happens. You will learn\nto write through writing, and you will likely be terrible when you start and\nget betterâlike everything else.</p><p>I\nmade a video about this very subject for my friend John Green when he was out\nhaving a child. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyhv80HDSj4\">Iâll include the link here</a> because it says pretty much\neverything I have to say in the subject. I also say it in a very unfortunate\nway that has an unintended double meaning, so enjoy. But the gist of the video\nis thisâ¦</p><p><b>3.\nDO NOT BE AFRAID TO BE BAD AT THIS</b></p><p>Thatâs\nwhatâs holding you back now. Youâre afraid you donât know enough. No one knows\nenough when they start. No one ever knows enough, really. You just have to\nstart. Write terribly. Go on. Do it. Then keep writing and improve. That is how\nit goes. No one would expect you to pick up a violin and instantly know how to\nplay because youâre heard some other people playing the violin. You will get\nbetter with practice. You donât have to show your work to anyone until you feel\nready, and it may take years to feel ready. Good. Fine. Thatâs normal. No one knows what they are doing when they start. They just have to start with GUSTO.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://78.media.tumblr.com/d22a54f42019076954745543eeba18d2/tumblr_inline_nnbipxxJxn1r0pfzu_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p><i><b>GUSTO.</b></i></p><p>The\nfact that you are asking this question at all means something in you is saying,\nâI should just do this thing.â I think you should listen to that voice and do\nthis thing. You can always read the books in the time you arenât writing. This\nisnât the kind of thing where you have to read ALL THE BOOKS before you start.\nJust start writing.</p><p>And\ndo not drink salad dressing.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Auntie\nMJ</p><p><br/></p><p><i>Ask Auntie MJ is a thing Maureen Johnson does once a week, usually between Wednesday and Friday, whether anyone wants her to or not.
