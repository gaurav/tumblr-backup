   "quote-text" : "<p>Later, my low-cut tanks and love of swing dancing brought on peer criticism. A girl from my cross-country team threw rocks at me in PE with no explanation for her actions for most of freshman year. Despite (or maybe because of) my attempts to be perfect and blameless, I was unable to blend in. </p>\n\n<p>Most of our conservative town went to youth group as well as church. Like most of my friends, I wore a WWJD bracelet and a promise ring. My promise or purity ring was shaped like a fish with a fake diamond inside. It meant I wasn&rsquo;t going to do anything nasty with anyone but my future husband. Some people talked about it meaning I was married to Jesus. The cheap ring turned my finger green.</p>",
