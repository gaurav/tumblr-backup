   "quote-text" : "The greatest obstacle to any dissertation writer, by far, is the all-too-common tendency (conscious or not) to try to avoid the negative feelings associated with the difficult stages of the writing process. If you make writing a part of your work-week routine, there will be good and bad days. On the good days, the prose will flow out of you at a rate that you didnât think was possible. Or youâll finally figure out how you want to argue your main point. Or youâll realize that what you thought was one chapter is actually two or three different ones. On the bad days, nothing that you write will seem good enough. Youâll hit the backspace and delete keys so much that theyâll start sticking. Youâll move the same paragraph five times before you delete it out of frustration. The trick is to go with the ebb and flow of writing, to ride out the bad days.",
