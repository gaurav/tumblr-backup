   "quote-text" : "<p>Iâm meeting boys who like Charles Bukowski and they all want to do brutal things to my body. They tell me they buy a bottle of whiskey whenever they get one of his books and donât stop reading till theyâve gone through a pack of cigarettes. They blow smoke in my face and say, âHe was the outcast king of L.A. Did you know that, huh?â âYeah, yeah, I know.â I say. âHeâs great.â </p>\n\n<p>A boy gives me a worn copy of <em>On the Road</em> and thinks heâs being original. âWe should explore the road together. Would you like that, baby?â I take a sip of my water and look away. Yes, Iâd like that, I think. But heâs drunk and imagining himself sixty years earlier, in the back of a bar, sweating to the sound of live bop. Still, I prefer him to the hungry boy that devoured my shirt and said, âYou have a tattoo? Whatâs it say?â âmad to live?â What, are you angry about living? Aw, Iâm just kidding, come here, let me take off that bra.â</p>\n\n<p>The next boy I kiss doesnât read. I ask him to come to a bookstore with me and he stays outside, sighing. He has no interest in words. He has no interest in me. I am thankful for him. For a few weeks, I am able to shed my habit of thinking obsessively and become a duller, rougher version of myself. I dump him when my fingers start turning imaginary pages in my sleep. </p>\n\n<p>I go on a date with a boy who knows I like to write. He calls himself a fan of mine and swears heâs read every word Iâve put down. âYouâve got this voice thatâs very modern, but also so classic.â I choke on my water as he says, âI read you to fall asleep.â I listen to him pant metaphors and compare my mouth to the sea. One day, he stumbles across my journal, and finds nothing about himself in it. âYou donât really love me, do you?â I shake my head. There is no use pretending anymore. He has read my poems about the boys I want to drown in me. His goodbye leaves my hands covers in ink. He wanted me so badly to be the sea, when all I am is a girl who writes poetry. </p>\n\n<p>I try my best to become poetry. I take a bath and stain the water with black ink. I cut my hair in a motel sink. I cry for people I have never met. I start smoking cigarettes. I use words like âpresumptuouslyâ and talk about âpost-modernist new wave.â I walk the streets at 4 a.m. and smile at people coming home from a rave. I wear sunglasses indoors. I carry a 500 page volume of poems wherever I go. I drink coffee instead of water. I talk about the âadvantages of using film and listening to records.â But no matter how hard I try, I am not the sea. I am a sunken ship that has drowned in everyone who touched me. </p>",
