Or is otherwise substantially atypical.</p>\n<p>And the adults in their life donât want them to feel different and suffer for it, so they donât talk to them about being disabled.</p>\n<p>And then they grow up without basic information about their body (or brain).</p>\n<p>And then every description of how people work is different from what the kid experiences. And itâs confusing and isolating, and hard to even realize how things are wrong.</p>\n<p>Because fish in water donât know they are wet. Itâs hard to know that the descriptions are wrong when you donât know itâs possible for them to be right.</p>\n<p>And then, sometimes, people who grow up that way eventually find out that they actually are different. That there is a word for the way their body and mind works. That there are other people like them, and that the world makes much more sense than they ever realized.</p>\n<p>Thatâs something that awareness should mean. Kids need to know how their minds and bodies work; atypical kids need accurate information just as much as other kids do. They just donât usually get it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&lt;screams this from the rooftops&gt;</p>\n<p>My parents intentionally didnât tell me I had cerebral palsy.</p>\n<p>I found out when I was twelve. From the school bully, who somehow figured it out herself.Â </p>\n<p>They didnât want me to feel different.Â </p>\n<p>I wore a brace I had to have surgery and PT and OT and when people asked why all I could tell them, literally, was âthereâs something wrong with me.âÂ </p>\n<p>They found out when I was nine that I had NLD, but they didnât push for formal dx and they certainly didnât explain to me why the things that were difficult for me were difficult.Â </p>\n<p>I drew graphs backwards in math class. I got lost everywhere I went. I couldnât make a sandwich independently. When I got to college I could barely feed myself and after a year of not being able to eat or shower and not knowing why, they told me it might be NLD.Â </p>\n<p>The clinician who finally got me a formal dx so I could get college services said âYou work very hard at things that come much easier to other people. Just trying to keep up must make you very tired. Do you often feel very tired?â</p>\n<p>I almost cried.Â </p>\n<p>Kids with atypical brains/bodies need ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THEMSELVES.Â </p>\n<p>it wonât make them feel like victims. it wonât make them feel more different, they already know theyâre different, trust me. Itâll empower them to take care of themselves.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>CO-FUCKING-SIGNED.</p>\n<p>My parents didnât tell me I was functionally blind when I was little.</p>\n<p>They werenât going to let me learn how to drive! They were perfectly happy to let me fail out of my favorite math class because I couldnât read the test papers! I had OT and vision therapy and people following me around in elementary school, and when I was six a friend tried to teach me how to climb a tree and I got stuck and my momÂ <em>flipped her shit</em>, but no one ever told meÂ <em>why</em>.Â </p>\n<p>I found out when I got ahold of my papers from when I was first evaluated when I was five. I found out when I read my vision assessment and realized thatÂ <em>hold up a second, I know what these scores mean, IâveÂ modifiedÂ materials for kids with these scores.</em></p>\n<p>I got in trouble for finding out and being upset about this, because of course I didâbut it was worth it, to know WHY my memories until I was 8 are all colors and blurs and close-up, why my depth perception doesnât change when I cover one eye, why I run into doors and walls every morning if I get up too fast, why visual illusions donât work on me, why the walls are always moving and my skin is always mottled and shaodws overlay everything, why at Stanford I always answered the experiments on vision in exactly the wrong ways, that the things thatÂ <em>were diagnosed by therapists without my history as hallucinationsÂ </em>were actually just my eyes being slow to integrate, that I wasnât fucking batshit, that everythingÂ <em>really does look differently</em> to me.</p>\n<p>I still donât believe it sometimes?</p>\n<p>But guys, for the love of god,Â <em>tell your kids</em>.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wasnât told about my learning disabilities, or that I was ADHD until I was like, 12. Â Until then, it was âoh, Corina has difficultiesâ and generally being made to feel like I need to TRY HARDER cause itâs just a matter of me BEING LAZY. Even with the scraps of âaccommodationsâ I got. Â I didnât get a full IEP until grade 10, and by then I was thinking that it was CHEATING to use it. Â And thatâs WITHOUT the Autism diagnosis that finally happened in grade 12. Â </p>\n<p>I was made to feel like a MONSTER, a worthless, flawed piece of trash, because adults didnât want me to feel different from other kids. Â Fuck that, you ALWAYS know youâre different; itâs written in the scars on your skin and on your heart and on your mind. Â And even if the other kids donât see you taking your medication, even if you look otherwise completely ânormalâ, they know it too. Â And when they asked, all I could say was âmy brain works differentâ, cause thatâs the only answer I had. Â </p>\n<p>One of my friendâs parents worked out the ADHD part, from meeting me ONCE, cause he was a psychiatrist. Â She told me I was ADHD, I said I didnât, then asked my parents, who said yes, I was diagnosed in kindergarten. Â </p>\n</blockquote>",
