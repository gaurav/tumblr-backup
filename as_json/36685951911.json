   "quote-text" : "<p>Through psychological autopsiesâdetailed assessments after deathâZhang and coauthors found that only 48% of 392 victims had a mental illness, they reported in the July 2010 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry. An earlier study of Chinese suicide victims put the prevalence of mental disorders at 63%âstill nowhere near as high as accepted models of suicide prevention would predict. Meanwhile, other standard risk factors simply don&rsquo;t hold true, or are even reversed, in China. Chinese women commit suicide at unusually high rates; rural residents kill themselves more frequently than city dwellers do; and marriage may make a person more, rather than less, volatile. </p>\n\n<p>Such differences matter because China accounts for an estimated 22% of global suicides, or roughly 200,000 deaths every year. In India, meanwhile, some 187,000 people took their own lives in 2010âtwice as many as died from HIV/AIDS. By comparison, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that suicides in high-income countries total only 140,000 a year. Suicide rates in Japan and South Korea, however, are similar to China&rsquo;s (see p. 1026), suggesting that this is a regional public health issue. And yet suicide in Asia is poorly understood. âSuicide has not gotten the attention it deserves vis-Ã -vis its disease burden,â says Prabhat Jha, director of the Centre for Global Health Research in Toronto, Canada.</p>",
