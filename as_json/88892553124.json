   "quote-text" : "<p>Club chapters often adopt schools, using gleaming, rumbling bikes to catch childrenâs attention, concentrating on those between seven and 14 or so, before they grow deaf to grown-ups bearing advice. âWe canât wait on the government. Weâve got to do this, because weâve lost a generation already,â says Greg Ward, chaplain of the Detroit chapter.</p>\n\n<p>Many Maryland members grew up in rough bits of Washington, before joining other black professionals in suburbs outside the capital. They make a point of heading back to the city when mentoring kids, among other good deeds. They explain that education, work andâabove allâthe capacity to delay gratification enabled them to buy $35,000 Harleys. That works better than abstract sermonising, says Donald Thigpen, an organiser of Buffalo Thunder: âThey know these bikes are very expensive, and nobody gave them to us.â Girls are not ignored. If bikes are not their thing, members tell the story of Cathay Williams, who disguised herself as a man to join an early Buffalo regiment.</p>",
