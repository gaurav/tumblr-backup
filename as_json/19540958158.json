   "quote-text" : "<p>In fourth grade, Wyatt started using &ldquo;Nicole&rdquo; as a name, and many classmates were calling him &ldquo;Nikki&rdquo;. The next year, the family went to court and had the name legally changed to Nicole.</p>\n\n<p>To Kelly, it seemed the next logical step. Family discussions merely centered around what the name would be. In the end, Nicole chose it. &ldquo;I believed in Nicole&rdquo;, her mother says. âShe always knew who she was&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Wayne was nervous. Could he call his son Nicole? As usual, he relied on his wife&rsquo;s instincts. &ldquo;I have to tell you, Kelly&rsquo;s the leader in our family&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;Both she and Nicole are extremely strong-willed, and I went with the flow.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>At first, though, he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to use the new name. An Air Force veteran and former Republican, he realizes now he was grieving the loss of a son. &ldquo;But once you get past that, I realize I never had a son&rdquo;, he says.</p>",
