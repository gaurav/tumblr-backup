A zombieâs ability to hunt wonât be hindered by darkness, but yours will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You guys make me scared that this is actually happening now..</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is amazing butÂ <strong><em>PLEASE DO NOT LIGHT ZOMBIES ON</em> <em>FIRE.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Zombies burn, yes, but they are still human-bodied and the human body takes extreme temperatures to burn completely - temperatures only found in industrial incinerators and crematoriums, <em>not</em> temperatures from ignited clothing or even gasoline fires (and why would you want to waste fuel anyway?).Â Zombies are immune to pain and can function withÂ <em>extreme bodily damage</em>. They will continue to come after you until the brain is damaged enough to kill them permanently, andÂ <em>bone does not burn easily.Â </em></p>\n<p>This means you wonât just have zombies after you, but flaming zombies. They will ignite anything they walk past, which could be incredibly dangerous if you find yourself in cramped areas with them. If you are in a building, this is even worse -Â theyÂ <em>will</em> light fire to the building!Â <em><br/></em></p>\n<p>Now, not only do you have flaming zombies to worry about, but also smoke inhalation - and the smoke from burning zombie flesh will not be good for you, even if you do escape.Â <em>Do not use fire in a zombie apocalypse unless you are absolutely sure you have it under control</em>. Fire is not your friend and you are not its master. It is dangerous and unpredictable and you do not need any more hazards to worry about.</p>\n<p>Only burn zombies if you have them trapped in a place that will not catch fire easily, you have a reliable escape route, and the fire can be controlled (for example, disposing of mass zombies in a fire pit). Otherwise,Â <em>do not use fire.</em></p>\n</blockquote>",
