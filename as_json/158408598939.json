   "quote-text" : "<p>To really understand what these cats can accomplish, Wilson wanted to study wild ones. He flew to northern Botswana, where a local charity had been studying five cheetahs using tracking collars. Wilson replaced these with new ones of his own design, which could record the animalsâ position and acceleration, and were programmed to record more data if the animals were moving quickly. âIâm very proud of the design,â says Wilson. âWe made all the hardware and software ourselves.â</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n\n<p>Wilson recorded a total of 367 runs, of which a quarter ended in a kill. There were many surprises. Wildlife documentaries typically show these cats hunting during the day in open grassland. But Wilsonâs individuals were hunting day and night. They also made half their runs among shrubs or thick vegetation, and were actually <em>more</em> successful in thicker cover.</p>\n\n<p>The collars cemented the catsâ speedy reputation. The fastest individual, appropriately named Ferrari, hit a top speed of 59 mph, very close to the reported 64 mph maximum. And while that old measurement was taken on a flat, track-like surface, Ferrari was running through vegetation.</p>\n\n<p>But most of the time, the cheetahs didnât run as fast as they could. Across their hunts, their average top speed was just 33 mph (15 metres per second) and they only hit that for one or two seconds. Thatâs because speed isnât the critical factor in a huntâwhen the cheetahs killed their prey, they werenât running any faster than when they flubbed their hunts.</p>\n\n<p>Itâs manoeuvrability that matters. To hunt agile prey like impala, cheetahs have to dodge and weave, which becomes much harder at full pelt. Just think about how much harder it is to turn a car at 60 mph than at 20 mph. âIf you want to catch something, you donât want to go faster than you have to,â says Wilson. âManoeuvring becomes harder if you go quickly.â So, perhaps counter-intuitively, the ability to <em>slow down sharply</em> before a turn is incredibly important.</p>\n\n<p>Cheetahs accomplish this with leg and back muscles that make up half its body weight. These contract at such high speeds that each kilogram of muscle generates 100 watts of power. For comparison, greyhounds produce just 60 watts with the same amount of muscle, horses manage just 30 watts, and Usain Bolt can produce just 25. With these powerful muscles, a cheetah can speed up or slow down by up to 9 mph in a single stride. The cat is like a sports car that always runs on second gear.</p>",
